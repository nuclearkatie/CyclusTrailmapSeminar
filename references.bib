	abstract = {Key components of a novel methodology and implementation of an agent-based, dynamic nuclear fuel cycle simulator, Cyclus , are presented. The nuclear fuel cycle is a complex, physics-dependent supply chain. To date, existing dynamic simulators have not treated constrained fuel supply, time-dependent, isotopic-quality based demand, or fuel fungibility particularly well. Utilizing an agent-based methodology that incorporates sophisticated graph theory and operations research techniques can overcome these deficiencies. This work describes a simulation kernel and agents that interact with it, highlighting the Dynamic Resource Exchange (DRE), the supply-demand framework at the heart of the kernel. The key agent-DRE interaction mechanisms are described, which enable complex entity interaction through the use of physics and socio-economic models. The translation of an exchange instance to a variant of the Multicommodity Transportation Problem, which can be solved feasibly or optimally, follows. An extensive investigation of solution performance and fidelity is then presented. Finally, recommendations for future users of Cyclus and the DRE are provided.},

The main purpose of these calculations is to determine the most likely trends in the structural development and scales of the industry and the expected time frames when the new technologies will be needed. Their main benefit lies in the possibility of constructing a balanced picture, as close to reality as possible, of the future structure and developing on this basis a well-substantiated program for strategic scientific-technical policy. A brief presentation of a DESAE calculation of a scenario for nuclear power growth in the country up to 2100 is given. This scenario corresponds to the above-mentioned requirement of balance with respect to the consumption of natural uranium as well as the amount of electricity and heat that will be required.},

Using original qualitative focus group data, this exploratory study suggests that while nuclear energy stakeholder groups consider the same factors when assessing credibility (specifically, knowledge source, research funding, research methods, publication, and replication), groups differ in their assessments of what constitutes expertise, what demonstrates (or reduces) trustworthiness, and the relative prioritization of expertise versus trustworthiness. Overall, these results suggest it is important for science communication to consider audience-specific credibility, and raise questions about the potential impact of both funding sources and predatory journals on the perceived credibility of scientists.},

In this paper, we develop and apply recent subjectivity detection techniques to determine subjective and objective tweets towards the hot topic of nuclear energy. This will further help us to detect the presence or absence of social media bias towards Nuclear Energy. In particular, significant network motifs of words and concepts were learned in dynamic Gaussian Bayesian networks, while using Twitter as a source of information. We use reinforcement learning to update each weight based on a probabilistic reward function over all the weights and, hence, to regularize the sentence model. The proposed framework opens new avenues in helping government agencies manage online public opinion to decide and act according to the need of the hour.},

	abstract = {In today’s risk-filled society, it is vital to recognize not only the risks that we face every day, but also that knowledge of such risks spreads, above all, via mass media. Risk-related information contributes to our knowledge and affects how we perceive risks and what risk decisions we ultimately make. Among the most memorable disasters of risks taken in recent memory, the nuclear energy accident in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011 changed how the public, policymakers, and media outlets perceive and deliberate the risk of nuclear energy. In response, the research question of this study interrogates how media portrayed the risk of nuclear energy and how coverage of the technology changed after the accident at Fukushima. The study concentrates on how two Swiss newspapers covered nuclear energy between 2010 and early 2015. By using a broad definition of risk and an innovative empirical operationalization of the concept, the study identifies different risk attention phases in media coverage, each characterized by different focus on risk dimensions. Interestingly, results show that those media paid considerable attention to political decisions about the use of nuclear energy, and surprisingly, the detrimental dimension of risk was in focus even before the 2011 nuclear accident in Japan. Although the benefits of nuclear technology became obscured after Fukushima, they recuperated interest as early as a year later. Such results raise a question regarding risk decisions and the use of nuclear energy—namely, when do societies decide upon risks, and how do media portray the risk at that moment in time?},

Much of the burden of ill health suffered by Indigenous people today can be traced directly back to colonization. Indigenous peoples of all first world nations where colonization has occurred are experiencing epidemic proportions of chronic disease, higher levels of morbidity and mortality, and poorer health outcomes compared to non-Indigenous populations. Indigenist and decolonizing approaches to research with Indigenous peoples have emerged in recent years with the overall aim of recognition and inclusion of Indigenous epistemologies and ontologies within the western research paradigm. A significant barrier to achieving this is the disconnection between the dominant biomedical approach to health and the holistic understandings of health based on Indigenist philosophies and traditional healing practices and knowledges. Conducting research that can successfully inform and improve health services and outcomes for Indigenous peoples requires a decolonizing approach where the voices of Indigenous Elders and communities are the primary informants. Integrating Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing with western biomedical approaches requires respect for and inclusion of Indigenous Knowledge as healing methods that have preserved community and individual well-being for thousands of years.},

Indigenous communities have long experienced oppression by Western researchers. Is it possible to build a collaborative research knowledge that is culturally appropriate, respectful, honoring, and careful of the Indigenous community? What are the challenges in Western research, researchers, and Western university methodology research training? How have ‘studies’ – critical anti-racist theory and practice, cross-cultural research methodology, critical perspectives on environmental justice, and land-based education – been incorporated into the university to disallow dissent? What can be done against this disallowance? According to Eve Tuck and K Wayne Yang’s (2012) suggestion, this article did not use the concept of decolonization as a substitute for ‘human rights’ or ‘social justice’, but as a demand of an Indigenous framework and a centering of Indigenous land, Indigenous sovereignty and Indigenous ways of thinking. This article discusses why both research and researcher increasingly require decolonization so that research can create a positive impact on the participants’ community, and conduct research ethically. This article is my personal decolonization and reclaiming story from 15 years of teaching, research and service activities with various Indigenous communities in various parts of the world. It presents a number of case studies of an intervention research project to exemplify the challenges in Western research training, and how decolonizing research training attempts to not only reclaim participants’ rights in the research but also to empower the researcher. I conclude by arguing that decolonizing research training creates more empathetic educators and researchers, transforming us for participants, and demonstrating how we can take responsibility for our research.},

	abstract = {The terms ‘indigenous people(s)’ and ‘indigeneity’ are multiply ambiguous. Their use without further qualification obscures key differences between the various real-world circumstances that they are typically applied to. This leads to confusion when the label ‘indigenous’ is employed in formal deliberations over political, cultural and land rights. To achieve clarity, some further distinctions need to be observed, most importantly between ‘indigeny’ and ‘indigenism’, between ‘tribal’ and ‘indigenous’, and between ‘indigeny’ and ‘exogeny’. 
Indigeny (the continued habitation of the same specific places that one’s familial ancestors always lived in) differs qualitatively in its cultural, economic and psychological consequences from all other circumstances that are labelled ‘indigenous’. Most of the latter arise within the tacitly exogenous context that underpins modernity, which is made possible by not living continuously where one’s ancestors lived. These usages are examples of ‘indigenism’ in its several varieties, rather than indigeny. The exogenous framework emphasises formal rationality and codified legal systems, which makes it difficult for the ‘native-title’ concerns of truly place-linked indigenous people to be argued for and judged fairly in court. Without due care, therefore, indigenist arguments may sometimes act against the interests of true place-linked indigenes.
Further confusion results from the conventional use of ‘indigenous’ as a synonym of ‘tribal’, which brings together two distinct and sometimes antithetical social circumstances under a single label, since it is also authentically applicable to many peasant populations. Treating both tribespeople and peasants in an undifferentiated manner as simply ‘indigenous’ peoples misrepresents their distinct life-circumstances, especially with regard to matters of religion, language and mode of attachment to land.
Examples drawn from several different Asian countries demonstrate the varying and sometimes antithetical ways in which the idea of ‘indigenous peoples’ has been applied – or ignored – and hence the necessity to employ it with more care than has usually been the case.},

	abstract = {A questionnaire was administered to 47 participants attending a workshop on nuclear energy shortly after publication of a report on a proposed nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. Supporters and opponents of the proposed development differed markedly in their estimates of its possible consequences, and of the relative importance of these consequences. They also differed in their endorsement of pro- and anti-nuclear lobbies, and the factors which they felt contributed most to the “quality of life”. Overall, pro-nuclear subjects appear to place emphasis on the economic benefits of nuclear energy, while anti-nuclear subjects appearad more concerned with social and political risks, and regraded alternative energy sources as more viable. It is concluded that an analysis of such attitudinal differences requires a consideration not only of differences in beliefs, but also of differences in belief salience.},

	abstract = {Since the 1960’s the United States of America has launched several space missions using nuclear technology as a mean for propulsion and power supply. The majority of the American nuclear powered spacecrafts were based in radioisotope generators, with the exception of the SNAP-10A (1965), which was the only American reactor ever launched. However, some of the most notorious nuclear reactor based projects developed in the USA in the last four decades were the SPAR/SP-100 (an evolution of the Space Power Advanced Reactor program), the Space Prototype (SP-100), the Prometheus, and the Fission Surface Power (FSP). The latter is still in progress and the others were closed before its completion. This paper describes the main details about each one of these projects with the purpose of serving as a review of the technical history for the major realization steps that were conducted in the USA. This manuscript also approaches the contemporary state-of-the-art, with emphasis to the Demonstration Using Flattop Fission (DUFF) experiment and it’s follow-on project, the Kilopower prototype reactor. © 2018, Journal of Aerospace Technology and Management.

	abstract = {SafeGuards Analysis (SGA) is a computational toolbox able to simulate different safeguards scenarios across a number of different fuel cycles and at many different scales within a Matlab Simulink framework. SGA functions by simulating Material Balance Areas (MBAs) under safeguards materials control and accountability and allows the user to define the uncertainty parameters of the associated flow and inventory measurements. The simulated safeguard system uses the uncertain measurement estimates to calculate mass-balance across the MBA. This mass balance is then evaluated by one or more of a number of different statistical tests to determine if a significant amount of material has been removed from the MBA. This thesis describes the development of SGA, and presents a number of example scenarios consisting of one or more MBAs. The goal of each of these scenarios is to determine the ability of SGA to calculate the Type I (false detect) or Type II (missed detection) error probability of the scenario. In each of these example scenarios, SGA generated reasonable results. To fully demonstrate SGA’s capabilities, the thesis also examines a more complicated scenario representative of a closed fuel cycle. This examination is paired with the operations research NUclear Measurement System Optimization (NUMSO) toolbox which calculates the best configuration of measurements based on a user-defined set of objectives. The two toolboxes allow a user to develop quickly develop a potentially optimal safeguards system with NUMSO, and then use SGA to examine the detailed behavior of that system. In every example considered in the thesis, SGA performs as designed.},

	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle can be performed using a wide range of techniques and methodologies. Past efforts have focused on specific fuel cycles or reactor technologies. The CYCLUS fuel cycle simulator seeks to separate the design of the simulation from the fuel cycle or technologies of interest. In order to support this separation, a robust supply–demand communication and solution framework is required. Accordingly an agent-based supply-chain framework, the Dynamic Resource Exchange (DRE), has been designed implemented in CYCLUS. It supports the communication of complex resources, namely isotopic compositions of nuclear fuel, between fuel cycle facilities and their managers (e.g., institutions and regions). Instances of supply and demand are defined as an optimization problem and solved for each timestep. Importantly, the DRE allows each agent in the simulation to independently indicate preference for specific trading options in order to meet both physics requirements and satisfy constraints imposed by potential socio-political models. To display the variety of possible simulations that the DRE enables, example scenarios are formulated and described. Important features include key fuel-cycle facility outages, introduction of external recycled fuel sources (similar to the current mixed oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication facility in the United States), and nontrivial interactions between fuel cycles existing in different regions.},

The methodology is demonstrated using a two-person sequential game with uncertainty, where the two players represent a policy maker and an electric utility company, though the method generalizes to any number and type of individual decision making entities. Coupled with a sophisticated nuclear fuel cycle simulator, rich transition scenarios may be analyzed to identify robust transition strategies. These strategies explicitly treat uncertainties using a stochastic programming approach, devising optimal near-term hedging strategies that simultaneously consider all possible states of the world, maintaining flexibility to allow for intelligent recourse decisions once uncertainties are resolved. In the demonstration game, reactor technology and fuel cycle scheme adopted by the electric utility are shown to depend on both the policy maker’s decisions and the distributions over uncertain technological and economic outcomes.},

This paper shows the main features of the code and the facilities that can be simulated. Additionally, a comparison between several codes and ANICCA has also been made to verify the performance of the code by means of a simulation proposed in the last NEA (OECD) Benchmark Study. Finally, a case study of the Belgian nuclear fuel cycle phase out has been carried out to show the possible impact of the transmutation of the minor actinides on the nuclear waste by the use of an Accelerator Driven System also known as ADS. Results show that ANICCA accomplishes its main purpose of simulating the scenarios giving similar outcomes to other codes. Regarding the case study, results show a reduction of more than 60\% of minor actinides in the Belgian nuclear cycle when using an ADS, reducing significantly the radiotoxicity and decay heat of the high-level waste and facilitating its management.},

In order to extend the validity of these analyses, two different codes, ANICCA and TR\_EVOL (developed respectively by SCK·CEN and CIEMAT), have been benchmarked through a study of an advanced and realistic nuclear fuel cycle scenario with the aim of assessing the impact of the use of different tools in the fuel cycle scenario uncertainty quantification. Additionally, a classical uncertainty propagation analysis was done following the total Monte Carlo and sensitivity approaches in order to compare the system uncertainties with the dissimilarities due the simulators. Results shows that the impact of the fuel cycle simulators cannot be neglected for certain observables, and that their effects become relevant as the scenarios extends over time due their cumulative effect.},

	abstract = {The production of super-heavy transuranium elements by stellar nucleosynthesis processes remains an open question. The most promising process that could potentially give rise to the formation of such elements is the so-called rapid neutron-capture process, or r-process, known to be at the origin of approximately half of the A{\textgreater}60 stable nuclei observed in nature. However, despite important efforts, the astrophysical site of the r-process remains unidentified. Here, we study the r-process nucleosynthesis in material that is dynamically ejected by tidal and pressure forces during the merging of binary neutron stars. Neutron star mergers could potentially be the dominant r-process site in the Galaxy, but also due to the extreme neutron richness found in such environment, could potentially synthesise super-heavy elements. R-process nucleosynthesis during the decompression is known to be largely insensitive to the detailed astrophysical conditions because of efficient fission recycling, producing a composition that closely follows the solar r-abundance distribution for nuclei with mass numbers A{\textgreater}140. During the neutron irradiation, nuclei up to charge numbers Z≃110 and mass number A≃340 are produced, with a major peak production at the N=184 shell closure, i.e. around A≃280. Super-heavy nuclei with Z{\textgreater}110 can hardly be produced due to the efficient fission taking place along those isotopic chains. Long-lived transuranium nuclei are inevitably produced by the r-process. The predictions concerning the production of transuranium nuclei remain however very sensitive to the predictions of fission barrier heights for such super-heavy nuclei. More nuclear predictions within different microscopic approaches are needed.},

The public, with its own opinion about nuclear power stations, has an influential voice in this discussion. As a result, policy makers and nuclear scientists are interested in the public's perception of nuclear power and in what determines this perception. We therefore examined an explanatory model of the public's acceptance of nuclear power based on a telephone survey among a representative sample in Switzerland. The model included such factors as risk perception, benefit perception, affective feelings, and social trust. Moreover, we distinguished between two types of benefit perception: benefit for the climate and a secure energy supply. The model fitted very well to our data and explained acceptance very well. Acceptance was mainly influenced by perceived benefits for a secure energy supply and, to a lesser extent, both by perceived benefits for the climate and by risk perception. Affective feelings about nuclear power appeared to be a central factor in the model. Implications for communication about nuclear power stations and for further research are discussed.},

Therefore, it is important to understand the determinants of public acceptance of nuclear power. This study examines the effects of knowledge, trust, risk, and benefit related factors on public acceptance of nuclear power across 19 countries. We consider three levels of public acceptance – strongly accept, reluctantly accept, and oppose – and classify countries into four groups according to the ratio of those three levels of public acceptance. Our results indicate that knowledge of nuclear inspection is more effective than trust in inspection authorities in creating stronger public acceptance among people in the countries with a high level of reluctant acceptance and a low level of strong acceptance, while trust in inspection authorities is more important than knowledge of nuclear inspection for the selection between opposition and reluctant acceptance in countries with a low level of reluctant acceptance and a high level of strong acceptance. Without grouping the countries, we found that trust in inspection authorities is crucial for the decision between opposition and reluctant acceptance. Additionally, the generation of electricity has the most positive effect on public acceptance of nuclear power.},

Our findings suggest that four themes could be identified in the debate and that these were formative for politicians in framing nuclear energy. Even though all political actors anticipate an energy transition towards a more sustainable system, different paths to advancing in this process were brought up in the debate, both with and without prolongation of the nuclear energy program. Our analysis suggests that framings of nuclear energy are closely related to the political ideologies of the parties in the Parliament because the two framings of nuclear energy correspond with the division of the Swedish Parliament into two political blocs. However, views on nuclear energy are not inherent to political ideologies but are constructed. This article thus integrates the politics of nuclear energy within the research on energy transitions.},

	abstract = {Whether or not there will be a "renaissance" of nuclear power in the near future may depend upon the nature of support for this energy source among citizens and elected officials. Continued examination of the predictors of opposition to nuclear power therefore remains quite policy relevant. While the existing literature finds modest but consistent gender differences in attitudes towards nuclear power in the general publics of several Western countries, the robustness of this relationship has seldom been investigated across time or among elected officials. This paper addresses both of these gaps. First, analyzing nationally representative data from the Swedish general public between 1986 and 2011, we confirm that the theoretically expected gender divide in opposition to nuclear power—whereby women report greater opposition than do men—is indeed robust over time. Second, examining data from three recent surveys of elected officials at the local, regional, and national levels in Sweden, we find that female elected officials at each polity level report greater opposition to nuclear power than their male counterparts. Our results are consistent with the health and safety concerns argument, whereby women are less supportive than are men of technologies with considerable perceived health and safety risks.},

	abstract = {Finding answers to main challenges of nuclear energy, like resource utilisation or waste minimisation, calls for transient fuel cycle modelling. This motivation led to the development of SITON v2.0 a dynamic, discrete facilities/discrete materials and also discrete events fuel cycle simulation code. The physical model of the code includes the most important fuel cycle facilities. Facilities can be connected flexibly; their number is not limited. Material transfer between facilities is tracked by taking into account 52 nuclides. Composition of discharged fuel is determined using burnup tables except for the 2400MW thermal power design of the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR2400). For the GFR2400 the FITXS method is used, which fits one-group microscopic cross-sections as polynomial functions of the fuel composition. This method is accurate and fast enough to be used in fuel cycle simulations. Operation of the fuel cycle, i.e. material requests and transfers, is described by discrete events. In advance of the simulation reactors and plants formulate their requests as events; triggered requests are tracked. After that, the events are simulated, i.e. the requests are fulfilled and composition of the material flow between facilities is calculated. To demonstrate capabilities of SITON v2.0, a hypothetical transient fuel cycle is presented in which a 4-unit VVER-440 reactor park was replaced by one GFR2400 that recycled its own spent fuel. It is found that the GFR2400 can be started if the cooling time of its spent fuel is 2years. However, if the cooling time is 5years it needs an additional plutonium feed, which can be covered from the spent fuel of a Generation III light water reactor.},

The objective of this paper is to identify some of the “must test” functionalities of a fuel cycle simulator tool within the context of specific problems of interest to the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign within the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE). This paper identifies the features needed to cover the range of promising fuel cycle options identified in the DOE-NE Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening and categorizes these features to facilitate prioritization. Features are categorized as essential functions, integrating features, and exemplary capabilities. A library of unit tests applicable to each of the essential functions should be developed as future work. An international dialog on the functionalities and standard test methods for fuel cycle simulator tools is encouraged.},

	url = {https://www.kincardinerecord.com/story.php?id=8751},
	abstract = {Kincardine councillor Laura Haight is disappointed at the loss of Ontario Power Generation (OPG)'s proposed Deep Geologic Repository (DGR) for low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste at the Bruce Nuclear site in the Municipality of Kincardine.

Haight was addressing OPG representatives, in committee-of-the-whole Monday night (March 2).
 
Lise Morton (left), vice-president of nuclear waste management; and Fred Kuntz, senior manager, corporate relations and projects for Bruce County, were at the council meeting to bring an update on what has been happening at OPG.

During that presentation, Morton stated that OPG respects the decision by the Saugeen Ojibway Nation (SON) which voted against the DGR, Jan. 31. Now, the company has to move forward and develop alternate solutions for permanent disposal of the low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste.

She said this will be done with stakeholder engagement, including indigenous groups and municipalities. “A priority will be continuing our efforts in waste minimization.”

Mayor Anne Eadie said the DGR hosting agreement has now ended and council will have to consider its role as it continues to host the low- and intermediate-level waste at the Bruce site. “We will be discussing this at our March 16 meeting.”

Haight said there has to be a federal policy regarding indigenous groups.
 

“The Municipality of Kincardine finds itself in a weird situation,” she said. “All these years, we were never told that this DGR project would be subject to a populous vote by SON. While I respect their decision, this project was going to be based on science and worldwide best practices.

“We've been out there for the past 20 years telling people this is the best solution – putting the waste underground where it's safer, rather than leaving it in interim storage. Now, what do we tell them? Oh, don't worry, it's still safe?”

She said that Morton mentioned additional buildings at the Western Waste Management Facility, also located at the Bruce Nuclear site.

“How much of the waste from Bruce Power's Major Component Replacement (MCR) project was going into the DGR?” asked Haight. "What are you doing about that? Are you making the waste facility three times as big – 10 times as big?

“I'm really so disappointed at how this turned out at the end.

“We need a federal policy. We can't expect OPG or Bruce Power or the Municipality of Kincardine to negotiate with indigenous groups over treaty rights. That's the federal government's job. We needed a national nuclear policy 10 years ago.

“I'm really upset about this. We have to get this fixed, and we have to start with the federal government.

“We're still the host community. We still have the waste here. We should get more money."

Eadie said she was also disappointed that the DGR project was turned down after all these years.

“The low- and intermediate-level waste is already at the Bruce site,” she said. “The DGR was the best long-term solution. The Municipality of Kincardine and its residents, and the surrounding communities all supported it as well.”

Deputy mayor Marie Wilson asked how this affects the DGR hosting agreement. She also asked that since this low- and intermediate-level waste has been stored at the Bruce site for decades, what differentiates from interim and permanent storage?

Regarding the DGR hosting agreement, Morton said a letter was sent to the municipality, dated Feb. 20, stating that OPG is terminating the agreement, effective March 30, 2020. At that point, all money held in trust (50-per-cent payments, beginning in 2018) will be returned to OPG. Once the agreement is terminated, the payments will cease.

OPG will be making its final payment to the municipality for 2020 once necessary steps to close the project are taken, states the letter. This payment will be made via direct deposit to the municipality by April 30, 2020.

As for when waste is in interim versus permanent storage, Morton said the main difference is that when the waste is in long-term storage, it is never moved again, and its radioactivity is continuously monitored over the next decades and centuries.

She noted that the current interim storage has a defined life; after 50-100 years, new storage will have to be built to replace it.

Councillor Bill Stewart pointed out the financial impact on the Municipality of Kincardine which was receiving a host-community payment of \$400,000 per year. Plus, the payment-in-lieu of taxes at the Bruce site (owned by OPG), has decreased by \$100,000 this year.

“So, in 2021, we're already going to take a hit of half-a-million bucks,” he said.

As the presentation came to a close, Kuntz said OPG appreciates the municipality's stalwart support of the DGR project over the past 15 years.},

The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle options that make nuclear energy technology more desirable. Successfully analyzing the transitions from the current fuel cycle to these promising fuel cycles requires a nuclear fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This work introduces and demonstrates the demand-driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, an open-source nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework. User-controlled capabilities such as time-series forecasting algorithms, supply buffers, and facility preferences were introduced to give users tools to minimize power undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. The demand-driven deployment capabilities are referred to as d3ploy. We demonstrate the capability of d3ploy to predict future commodities’ supply and demand, and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet the predicted demand in four transition scenarios. Using d3ploy to set up transition scenarios saves the user simulation setup time compared to previous efforts that required a user to manually calculate and use trial and error to set up the deployment scheme for the supporting fuel cycle facilities.},

	abstract = {With the aging of current isotope-producing reactors and the rising demand for medical isotopes, future shortages are predicted to greatly increase the cost of Mo-99. Molten salt reactors have been proposed for the production of Mo-99, and have the potential for safe, efficient operation at a variety of scales. However, while Mo-99 is a major fission product, it is unclear how accessible it will be for direct extraction from a fuel salt given its relatively short half-life. In this study, a computationally efficient mathematical model was used to analyze fission product accumulation in an MSR, with the specific goal of assessing Mo-99 production by continuous or near-continuous extraction from the reactor. The model includes generation and removal of isotopes in an MSR from fission, decay, activation and extraction. The extraction process was assumed to be mass-transfer limited, owing to the noble behavior and relatively low concentration of molybdenum in the reactor. It was found that the concentration at which Mo was present in the reactor had a profound effect on the specific activity of the Mo-99 that could be successfully extracted. If molybdenum is allowed to buildup in the reactor, the majority of Mo-99 is lost by decay or activation, leaving only a small fraction of Mo-99 in the extracted molybdenum. Therefore, separation processes that require a high relative molybdenum concentration for extraction are not desirable. On the other hand, separation processes become more difficult at low concentrations. Thus, a trade-off exists between the difficulty of the separation and effectiveness of the extraction as measured by the recovery fraction and product quality. It was found that increasing the power density enabled improved Mo-99 recovery for separation processes at increased concentrations. These results demonstrate the use of a model to explore the viability of Mo-99 extraction from an MSR, the influence of operating parameters on that extraction, and the conditions under which Mo-99 extraction can be optimized.},

	abstract = {The global warming, the increase of world population and the depletion of fossil resources have lead us in a major energy crisis. Using electronuclear energy could be one of the means to solve a part of these issues. The way out of this crisis may be enlightened by the study of transitional scenarios, guiding the political decisions. The reliability of those studies passes through the wide variety of the simulation tools and the comparison between them. From this perspective and in order to perform complex electronuclear scenario simulation, the open source Core Library for Advance Scenario Simulation (CLASS) is being developed. CLASS main asset is its ability to include any kind of reactor, whether the system is innovative or standard. A reactor is fully described by its evolution database that must contain a set of different fuel compositions in order to simulate transitional scenarios. CLASS aims at being a useful tool to study scenarios involving Generation IV reactors as well as innovative fuel cycles, like the Thorium cycle. The following contribution will present in detail the CLASS software. Starting with the working principle of this tool, one will explain the working process of the different modules such as the evolution module. It will be followed by an exhaustive presentation of the UOX-MOX bases generation procedure. Finally a brief analysis of the error made by the CLASS evolution module will be presented.},

	abstract = {154Eu is a nuclide of considerable importance to both non-destructive measurements of used nuclear fuel assembly burnup as well as for calculating the radiation source term for used fuel storage and transportation. However, recent evidence from code validation studies of spent fuel benchmarks have revealed evidence of a systemic bias in predicted 154Eu inventories when using ENDF/B-VII.0 and ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data libraries, wherein 154Eu is consistently over-predicted on the order of 10\% or more. Further, this bias is found to correlate with sample burnup, resulting in a larger departure from experimental measurements for higher sample burnups.

In this paper, the bias in 154Eu is characterized across eleven spent fuel destructive assay benchmarks from five different assemblies. Based on these studies, possible amendments to the ENDF/B-VII.0 and VII.1 evaluations of the 1454Eu(n,γ)155Eu are explored. By amending the location of the first resolved resonance for the 154Eu radiative capture cross-section (centered at 0.195 eV in ENDF/B-VII.0 and VII.1) to 0.188 eV and adjusting the neutron capture width proportional to sqrt(1/E), the amended cross-section evaluation was found to reduce the bias in predicted 154Eu inventories by approximately 5–7\%. While the amended capture cross-section still results in a residual over-prediction of 154Eu (ranging from 2\% to 9\%), the effect is substantially attenuated compared with the nominal ENDF/B-VII.0 and VII.1 evaluations.},

The following conclusions were drawn: 1) when Pu or transuranics(TRU) multi-cycled in fast reactors(FRs), the composition would reach equilibrium; for the referenced CFR1000, the fissile Pu took an equilibrium fraction of 70\%, and the minor actinides(MA) took an equilibrium fraction of 3\%(in TRU recycle); 2) the installed FRs capacity was sensitive to out-of-pile residence time and recovery ratio; the HLW generation was only sensitive to recovery ratio; the recommended value was, out-of-pile time be no more than 5a and actinides recovery ratio be no less than 99.9\%; 3) the synergistic development of pressurized water reactors(PWRs) and FRs could, not only improve uranium utilization, but also effectively reduce HLW generation; compared with PWRs with once-through cycle, FR with closed-fuel-cycle could reduce the long-term radioactive toxicity of HLW to 1/5–1/6 for Pu recycle and 1/7–1/8 for TRU recycle (both with 99.9\% recovery).},

It is able to represent a wide range of Sodium cooled Fast Reactor designs using oxide fuels and a wide range of fuel management strategies within fuel cycle simulation tools.

The process from these reference calculations to the final meta-model is explained and a specific focus is given to the operations going from detailed full core depletion results to global results suitable for neural networks training. Details on the creation process for neural networks based predictors, one for each average cross-section, and their training on full core depletion calculations are given as well as the implementation within the CLASS code. The irradiation meta-model achieves good precision on all major and minor actinides present in spent fuel. The designs and loaded fuel covered by the model allow significant burner to strong breeder strategies.

Continuous neutron fluxes at this intensity, which is approximately 100 times larger than is typically available in a large scale thermal reactor, appear practical, owing to recent advances in proton linear accelerator technology and to the spallation target-moderator design presented here. This large flux of thermal neutrons makes possible a waste inventory in the transmutation system which is smaller by about a factor of 100 than competing concepts. The accelerator allows the system to operate well below criticality so that the possibility for a criticality accident is eliminated. No control rods are required. The successful implementation of this new method for energy generation and waste transmutation would eliminate the need for nuclear waste storage on a geologic time scale. The production of nuclear energy from 232Th or 238U is used to illustrate the general principles of commercial nuclear energy, production without long-term high-level waste.

	abstract = {A parametric systems model of the accelerator transmutation of (nuclear) waste (ATW) is used to examine key system trade-offs and design drivers on the basis of unit costs. This model is applied primarily to a fluid-fuel blanket concept for an ATW that generates net electric power from the fissioning of spent commercial reactor fuel. An important goal of this study is the development of essential parametric trade-offs to aid in any future conceptual engineering design of an ATW that would burn spent commercial fuel and generate net electric power. As such, costing procedures and methodologies used to estimate and compare advanced nuclear power generation systems are applied. Hence, the cost of electricity (COE) (in mills per kilowatt-hour) is adopted as the primary object function with which to examine parametrically key system trade-offs; other costs, such as unit cost of installed (net) power [in dollars per watt(electric)], total cost (in dollars), total lifecycle cost (in dollars), and cost of product (in dollars per kilogram) are also reported. The COE required by an electrical power-generating ATW fueled with spent commercial fuel is generally found to be above that projected for other advanced fission power plants. The accelerator and the chemical plant equipment cost accounts are quantitatively identified as main cost drivers, with the capital cost of radio-frequency power dominating the former. Significant reductions of this cost differential are possible by increased blanket neutron multiplication, increased plant capacity, or increased thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency. The benefits of reduced long-lived fission products and spent commercial fuel actinides provided by the ATW approach translate into a less tangible source of revenue to be provided by a charge that must be levied on the client fission power plants being serviced. The main goal of this study, however, is not a direct cost comparison but is instead a quantitative determination of cost-based sensitivity of key cost drivers and operational modes for an ATW concept that would address the growing spent commercial fuel problem; parametric results presented focus on this goal, and a specific ATW “straw man” is given to achieve this main objective.},

	abstract = {Transmutation of long-lived nuclear waste (trans-uranic actinides and long-lived fission products) currently stored in spent reactor fuels may represent an attractive alternative to deep geologic disposal. The aqueous-based accelerator transmutation of waste (ATW) concept as proposed by Los Alamos National Laboratory uses a proton accelerator to produce a 1.6-GeV, 250-mA (∼400 MW) beam that is split four ways and directed to four D2O-cooled solid tungsten-lead composite targets. Each target in turn is centered in a heavy water moderated, highly multiplying, actinide (oxide)-slurry blanket. High thermal-neutron fluxes are produced that allow high transmutation reaction rates at low material (actinide, long-lived fission product) inventories. The target-blanket system for ATW resides at an interface separating two major systems that are crucial to the economic and technical success of the concept: (a) the high-energy (power-intensive) accelerator delivering 0.8 to 1.6 GeV protons to the high-Z spallation neutron source and (b) the chemical-plant equipment (CPE) that provides feedstock appropriate for efficient and effective transmutation. Parametric studies have been performed to assess the effects of the target-blanket on overall system performance with regard to neutron economy, chemical-processing efficiency, and thermal-hydraulic design options. Based on these parametric evaluations, an interim base-case aqueous-slurry ATW design was selected for more detailed analyses. This base-case target-blanket consists of an array of Zr-Nb pressure tubes placed in a heavy water moderator surrounding a heavy-water-cooled tungsten-lead target. Neutronics and thermal-hydraulic calculations focusing primarily on the blanket indicate that each of the four ATW target-blanket modules operating with a neutron multiplication keff = 0.95 can transmute the actinide waste and the technetium and iodine waste from ∼ 2.5 light water reactors (LWRs). In addition, by recovering and converting the fission heat, sufficient electricity can be produced both to operate the accelerator and to supply power to the grid for revenue generation; the full (400-MW beam) system would service ∼ 10 LWRs, which at 835 MW(thermal)/LWR (1363 mol/yr actinide), a thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency of 0.30, and an overall “wall-plug” accelerator efficiency of 0.50 would allow about two-thirds of the 2500-MW(electric) (gross) power to be delivered to the grid. The neutronics-, thermal-hydraulics-, and accelerator-CPE-interface consideration, needed to ensure this performance, is examined for the aqueous-slurry ATW. These broad-based parametric studies have provided guidance to a preliminary conceptual engineering design of the aqueous-slurry ATW blanket concept.},

	abstract = {This study aims to assess the likelihood for criticality in the far field of a repository for direct disposal of commercial light water reactor used nuclear fuel. Two models are used in combination: (1) a neutronics model to estimate the minimum critical masses of spherical, water-saturated depositions of fissile material; (2) a transport model to simulate the dissolution of waste packages arranged in an array and the subsequent transport of fissile solutes through fractured bedrock to a single accumulation location. The neutronics model shows that heavy metals from different types of used fuel present the same minimum critical mass behavior in the parameter space of initial enrichment and burnup, dictated largely by the fissile content. However, the magnitude of the minimum critical mass varies significantly within that parameter space, and secondary effects like the presence of absorbing nuclides play a minor role. The transport model employs various subsurface transport scenarios, and for each scenario the mass of each isotope and the overall fissile content of the accumulation is reported from the time of canister failure up to one hundred million years at various distances from the repository edge. Taking the results of the two models in concert, it is shown that even if the accumulation of a critical mass is possible under conservative conditions, these conditions are unlikely to be present in the vicinity of a carefully engineered repository. Based on the results of each model, recommendations for risk mitigation in terms of waste characteristics and repository design are given.},

The accuracies of radiation dose rate estimation and computational efficiencies of each geometry model with two cross-sectional data-sets are compared. The use of automated variance reduction techniques can significantly improve the computational efficiency of such a realistic, deep penetration problem that involves radiation transport from different volumetric sources, thereby eliciting only a small statistical error. Monaco with Automated Variance Reduction using Importance Calculations (MAVRIC) is a computational sequence within the SCALE 6.2 code package based on consistent adjoint driven importance sampling (CADIS), a type of automated variance reduction technique. Homogenous and full fuel assembly models are built herein, and two nuclear cross-section libraries (V7-200N47G and continuous energy) are applied in this work. Based on the detailed comparisons, we found that neutron dose rate estimation is more dependent on geometry modeling than on cross-section data. For neutron-induced gamma rays, the dose rate distribution depends on both the spatial self-shielding effect and the cross-section library. The primary gamma rays respectively contribute to the total dose rate by ∼91\% and ∼99\% on the side and top surfaces, and the dose rate accuracy is more dependent on the cross-section library than on geometry modeling. In terms of the computation efficiency and efforts spent on geometry modeling, the homogenous fuel assembly model with the MG library can produce an acceptable dose rate distribution, but the detailed fuel assembly model with the continuous-energy library is required for more precise dose rate estimation.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the Los Alamos National Laboratory Accelerator Transmutation of (Nuclear) Waste (ATW) project is the substantial reduction in volume of long-lived high-level radioactive waste of the United States in a safe and energy-efficient manner. An evaluation of the ATW concept has four aspects: material balance, energy balance, performance, and cost. An evaluation of the material balance compares the amount of long-lived high-level waste transmuted with the amount and type of waste created in the process. One component of the material balance is the activation of structural materials over the lifetime of the transmutation reactor. A preliminary radioactivity and radioactive mass balance analysis has been performed on four structure regions of the reaction chamber: the tungsten target, the lead annulus, six tubing materials carrying the actinide slurry, and five reaction vessel structural materials. The amount of radioactive material remaining after a 100-yr cooling period for the base-case ATW was found to be 338 kg of radionuclides. The bulk of this material (313 kg) was generated in the zirconium-niobium (Zr-Nb) actinide tubing material. Replacement of the Zr-Nb tubing material with one of the alternative tubing materials analyzed would significantly reduce the short- and long-term radioactive mass produced. The alternative vessel materials Al-6061 alloy, Tenelon, HT-9, and Cr-1 Mo and the alternative actinide tubing materials Al-6061 alloy, carbon-carbon matrix, silicon carbide, and Ti-6 Al-4 V qualify for shallow land burial. Alternative disposal options for the base-case structural material Type 304L stainless steel and the actinide tubing material Zr-Nb will need to be considered as neither qualifies for shallow land burial.},

Separation of active fission products from actinide was confirmed by a transportation of simulating fission product elements with and without imposing electropotential. The maximum cathode current density onto a liquid cadmium pool without formation of a dendrite was measured against the concentration, and it was found to decrease with increasing concentration of uranium in cadmium.

	abstract = {The demand for more practical and innovative nuclear reactor designs capable of providing clean energy to meet new global demands is revolutionizing the nuclear industry. In this paper we present the fuel cycle and neutronics analysis of a design expected to be similar to the Westinghouse eVinci™ heat pipe (HP) reactor. The concept considered here uses low enriched urania rods and potassium liquid metal-cooled HPs to remove heat from the core. The fuel and HPs are contained in steel monolith to form the core which is surrounded by an alumina reflector. There is no need for forced circulation to remove heat from the active core region, thus eliminating the use of pumps, valves and tube piping. The concept is designed to operate safely and provide a reliable autonomous power supply in support of off-grid missions. This study shows that the HP reactor design can operate for more than 10 years without refueling. Further, we show that the current design of the HP reactor concept is best suited to serve as a nuclear battery rather than a centralized power source. We also studied the nuclear fuel cycle performance of the HP reactor concept in a once-through fuel cycle. The natural resource utilization, waste output, and environmental impact, as defined in a reference study from the literature, did not perform as well on a GWe per year energy basis compared to light water reactors with less than 5\% enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle. Parasitic absorption in the steel monolith structure and neutron leakage lower the reactivity of the core, which decreases the discharge burnup of the fuel. Analysis of modifications of the monolith material and size of the reference core configuration showed that the neutron leakage impact on the small sized HP core is the most limiting factor on the fuel cycle performance.},

In order to lower the amount of nuclear wastes sent to the geological repository, an optimized scattered reloading scheme for ADS is proposed to maximize the discharge burnup and lower the burnup reactivity loss. Then the flexibility of ADS for MA transmutation is evaluated in this research. Three aspects are discussed, including: different cooling time of spent ADS fuels before reprocessing, different reprocessing loss of spent ADS fuels, and different top-up MAs recovered from different kinds of spent PWR fuels. The ADS system is flexible to be combined with various pyro-chemical reprocessing technologies with specific spent fuels cooling time and unique reprocessing loss. The reduction magnitudes of the long-term decay heat and radiotoxicity of MAs by transmutation depend on the reprocessing loss. The ADS system is flexible to transmute MAs recovered from different kinds of spent PWR fuels, regardless of UOX or MOX fuels. The reduction magnitudes of the long-term decay heat and radiotoxicity of different MAs by transmutation stay on the same order.},

	abstract = {The Seed-and-Blanket (S\&B) Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) core concept was proposed for generating a significant fraction of the core power from thorium fueled breed-and-burn (B\&B) blankets without exceeding the presently verified radiation damage constraint of 200 Displacement per Atom (DPA). To make beneficial use of the excess neutrons from fast reactors, the S\&B core is designed to have an elongated TRU transmuting (or “TRU burner”) seed from which over 20\% of the fission neutrons leak into a subcritical thorium blanket that radially surrounds the seed. The seed fuel is recycled while the blanket operates in a once-through breed-and-burn (B\&B) mode. The objective of this paper is to compare the fuel cycle performance of the S\&B reactor against an Advanced Burner Reactor (ABR) and a conventional Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). For the fast reactors (SFR: ABR and S\&B) the fuel cycle performance is evaluated based on a 2-stage PWR-SFR energy system while the reference nuclear system is made of once-through PWRs. It was found that relative to the ABR, the S\&B core has a lower fuel cycle cost, higher capacity factor, and comparable short-term radioactivity. The discharged seed fuel from the S\&B core features lower fissile Pu-to-Pu ratio, higher 238Pu-to-Pu ratio, higher specific plutonium decay heat, higher spontaneous fission rate, and lower overall material attractiveness for weapon use. Due to the significant amount of 233U discharged from the breed-and-burn thorium fueled blankets, the S\&B core has much higher long-term radioactivity and radiotoxicity. Since the thorium fueled blanket operates in the breed-and-burn mode and requires no fuel reprocessing, the discharged blanket fuel is unattractive for weapons application. Compared with a PWR, the S\&B core has a lower fuel cycle cost, much lower short-term radioactivity and radiotoxicity but higher long-term values, and higher proliferation resistance for the discharged plutonium. The natural uranium utilization of the 2-stage PWR-S\&B system is approximately 60\% higher than that of present PWRs; it is few percent higher than that of the 2-stage PWR-ABR system. Approximately 7\% of the thorium fed to the blanket is converted into energy, which makes the thorium fuel utilization approximately 12 times the utilization of natural uranium in PWRs. A comprehensive fuel cycle evaluation performed with the methodology developed by the recent U.S Department of Energy’s Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening campaign concludes that the PWR-S\&B system has similar fuel cycle performance characteristics as the PWR-ABR system. The S\&B concept may potentially feature improved economics and resource utilization relative to the ABR.},

For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

	abstract = {The recent Evaluation and Screening study chartered by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, has identified four fuel cycle options as being the most promising. Among these four options, the two single-stage fuel cycles rely on a fast reactor and are differing in the fact that in one case only uranium and plutonium are recycled while in the other case minor actinides are also recycled. The two other fuel cycles are two-stage and rely on both fast and thermal reactors. They also differ in the fact that in one case only uranium and plutonium are recycled while in the other case minor actinides are also recycled. The current study assesses the impact of recycling minor actinides on the reactor core design, its performance characteristics, and the characteristics of the recycled material and waste material. The recycling of minor actinides is found not to affect the reactor core performance, as long as the same cycle length, core layout and specific power are being used. One notable difference is that the required transuranics (TRU) content is slightly increased when minor actinides are recycled. The mass flows are mostly unchanged given a same specific power and cycle length. Although the material mass flows and reactor performance characteristics are hardly affected by recycling minor actinides, some differences are observed in the waste characteristics between the two fuel cycles considered. The absence of minor actinides in the waste results in a different buildup of decay products, and in somewhat different behaviors depending on the characteristic and time frame considered. Recycling of minor actinides is found to result in a reduction of the waste characteristics ranging from 10\% to 90\%. These results are consistent with previous studies in this domain and depending on the time frame considered, packaging conditions, repository site, repository strategy, the differences observed in the waste characteristics could be beneficial and help improve the repository performance. On the other hand, recycling minor actinides also results in an increase of the recycled fuel characteristics and therefore of the charged fuel. The radioactivity is slightly increased while the decay heat and radiotoxicities are very significantly increased. Despite these differences, the characteristics of the fuel at time of discharge remain similar whether minor actinides are recycled or not, with the exception of the inhalation radiotoxicity which is significantly larger with minor actinide recycling. After some cooling the characteristics of the discharged fuel become larger when minor actinides are recycled, potentially affecting the reprocessing plant requirements. Recycling minor actinides has a negative impact on the characteristics of the fresh fuel and will make it more challenging to fabricate fuel containing minor actinides.},

This paper discusses four most potential nuclear fuel cycle modes in China and analyzes the natural uranium requirements under these different fuel cycle modes first based on three development patterns (low-, medium-, and high-speed) of installed nuclear power capacity. Then, an optimization model including natural uranium requirements, spent fuel final disposal amounts and total cost of electricity generation is constructed and optimization problem under two scenarios of reprocessing capacity are solved and results discussed. The annual and cumulative natural uranium requirements under these two scenarios are also calculated. Finally some conclusions are put forward based on the analyses.},

The purpose of this study was to analyze the potential impacts associated with deploying thorium-based fuels in Pressure Tube Heavy Water Reactors (PT-HWRs) in a once-through fuel cycle in Canada, and to compare them with the use of conventional Natural Uranium (NU) fuel. This study analyzed a medium-burnup (∼19.1MWd/kg) Slightly Enriched Uranium-based fuel augmented by small amounts of thorium (SEU+Th) and a high-burnup (∼40.6MWd/kg) fuel made with Low Enriched Uranium mixed with thorium (LEU/Th). The deployment of the medium-burnup SEU+Th in Canada reduced resource consumption by 23\% relative to the low burnup NU fuel. The medium-burnup fuel required 3\% to 60\% fewer Deep Geological Repository (DGR) Used Fuel Containers (UFCs) relative to the low burnup fuel, depending on the decay time (10–70years) of the Used Nuclear Fuel (UNF). Extending the decay duration of UNF decreases its decay power per unit mass, and hence the required number of DGR UFCs per mass of UNF, at the expense of requiring more above-ground dry storage capacity.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous minor actinides transmutation is the process of loading neptunium, americium and curium in dedicated targets, generally located at the core periphery, in order to transmute these long-lived heavy nuclides into shorter-lived fission products. This has a positive effect on long-term radiotoxicity of the spent fuel and on the short to medium term decay heat of the final waste packages. However, given their location at the core periphery in a low flux zone, these targets are generally loaded with a high content in minor actinides in order to maintain acceptable transmutation performances. A significant part of the heavy nuclides produced by capture during irradiation being energetic alpha-emitters or strong neutron emitters, this leads to a very high activity in the irradiated targets which has negative impacts on the fuel cycle. In this paper, an optimization methodology of heterogeneous minor actinides transmutation is applied to the fuel cycle case in order to assess the constraints limiting transmutation. It appears that transportation of the fresh assemblies is the first limiting criterion due to the high decay heat of 241Am. Sodium washing at the end of irradiation is the second limiting criterion. It is shown that the geometrical design on the target assembly is not a concern considering the current limitations on the fuel cycle. It is also shown that using current industrial limitations and plutonium feed, it is not possible to achieve equilibrium between production of americium in the core and consumption in the blankets. It appears then that research should focus on the removal of fuel reprocessing limitations rather than standard assembly optimization.},

The ultimate purpose is transition to the all thorium fueled energy system with the bred 233U fuel burning in-site. The system consists of two fusion-fission hybrid reactors. The first reactor is a fast breeder which provides the starting fuel 233U for the second reactor (thermal burner). The bred 233U is burnt in the second reactor with the thorium bearing molten salt fuel blanket. In order to reach the multi-system performance, i.e. high energy multiplication M, tritium self-sufficiency and fissile fuel self-sufficiency, using limiting 233U start fuel, the seed-blanket concept is adopted in the thermal burner design. The thermal burner blanket is divided into two main regions. The front region (seed) plays the dominate role in the energy production, neutron multiplication and 233U breeding. Excess neutrons produced by the front region are then used to drive backward region (blanket) to breed tritium. The Couple 2.0 code developed by Tsinghua University is used to calculate the fuel depletion process of the whole system. The simulated results show, the thermal burner could operate with excellent performance, energy multiplication M (8–10), tritium breeding ratio TBR ({\textgreater}1.05) continuously and only natural thorium fuel is added into the system.},

This study compares the reactor and fuel cycle costs of the closed system associated with sodium-cooled fast reactors and pyroprocessing versus the once-through system. We specifically investigated the fuel cycle transition cases of the Republic of Korea from 2013 to 2100. The results revealed that the closed system (34.00 mills/kWh as a mean value) could be more expensive than the once-through system (32.75 mills/kWh). In contrast, the once-through fuel cycle costs (8.31 mills/kWh), excluding reactor costs, were projected to be greater than the closed fuel cycle costs (7.77 mills/kWh) because of the increased costs of interim storage estimated by the Korean government and the limited contribution of backend fuel cycle components to the discounted costs. The capital cost of sodium-cooled fast reactor is the largest component contributing to the cost gap between the two systems. Among fuel cycle components, pyroprocessing has the largest uncertainty contribution to the cost gap. We also calculated the breakeven unit costs of SFR capital cost and PWR spent fuel pyroprocessing cost.},

The objective of this paper is to identify some of the “must test” functionalities of a fuel cycle simulator tool within the context of specific problems of interest to the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign within the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE). This paper identifies the features needed to cover the range of promising fuel cycle options identified in the DOE-NE Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening and categorizes these features to facilitate prioritization. Features are categorized as essential functions, integrating features, and exemplary capabilities. A library of unit tests applicable to each of the essential functions should be developed as future work. An international dialog on the functionalities and standard test methods for fuel cycle simulator tools is encouraged.},

transitional scenarios, guiding the political decisions. The reliability of those studies passes
through the wide variety of the simulation tools and the comparison between them.
From this perspective and in order to perform complex electronuclear scenario simulation,
the open source Core Library for Advance Scenario Simulation (CLASS) is being developed.
CLASS main asset is its ability to include any kind of reactor, whether the system is innovative
or standard. A reactor is fully described by its evolution database that must contain a set of
different fuel compositions in order to simulate transitional scenarios. CLASS aims at being a
useful tool to study scenarios involving Generation IV reactors as well as innovative fuel cycles,
like the Thorium cycle.
The following contribution will present in detail the CLASS software. Starting with the work-
ing principle of this tool, one will explain the working process of the different modules such
as the evolution module. It will be followed by an exhaustive presentation of the UOX-MOX
bases generation procedure. Finally a brief analysis of the error made by the CLASS evolution

	abstract = {A review of existing analysis codes for nuclear fuel cycle systems was performed to determine if any existing codes meet technical and functional requirements de fined for a U.S. national program supporting the global and domestic assessment, development, and deployment of nuclear energy systems. The program would be imple mented using an interconnected architecture of d codes ranging from the fuel cycle analysis code, which is the subject of the review, to fundamental physical and mechanistic codes. Four main functions are defined for the code. Function 1 is the ability to characterize and deploy individual fuel cycle facilities and reactors in a simulation while discretely tracking material move ments. Function 2 is the capability to perform an uncer tainty analysis for each element of the fuel cycle and an aggregate uncertainty analysis. Function 3 is the inclu sion of an optimization engine able to optimize simulta neously across multiple objective functions. Function 4 is open and accessible code software and documentation to aid in collaboration between multiple entities and to facilitate software updates. Existing codes, categorized as annualized or dis crete fuel tracking codes, were assessed according to the fourfunctions and associated requirements. These codes were developed by various government, education, and industrial entities to fulfill particular needs. In some cases, decisions were made during code development to limit the level of detail included in a code to ease its use or to focus on certain aspects of a fuel cycle to address specific questions. The review revealed that while no two of the codes are identical, they all perform many of the same basic functions. No code was able to perform defined function 2 or several requirements of functions 1 and 3. Based on this review, it was concluded that the functions and requirements will be met only with development of a new code, referred to as GENIUS.},

This comparative study is aimed at screening and ranking the three selected NFC options against five aspects: sustainability, environmental friendliness, economics, proliferation resistance, and technical feasibility. The selected fuel cycle options include pressurized water reactor (PWR) once-through cycle, PWR mixed oxide cycle, or pyroprocessing sodium-cooled fast reactor cycle. A sensitivity analysis was performed to prove the robustness of the results and explore the influence of criteria on the obtained ranking.

	abstract = {The laser-Compton scattering (LCS) phenomenon is one known method for producing energetic and high-intensity gamma rays with variable photon spectrums. Availability of high-intensity gamma rays has made probing the (γ,n)-based photonuclear transmutation possible and worth consideration. Parametric studies of LCS have shown that the gamma ray’s spectrum is tunable and dependent upon various facility-related parameters. In this paper, a systematic optimization study of the LCS spectrum has been performed in view of the incident laser energy, electron beam energy and collimation angle. This optimization has been done with the aim to maximize the transmutation reaction rates of long-living fission products (LLFPs) such as 129I, 135Cs, and 137Cs that have an isotopic composition of typical LWR spent fuel. In addition, the (γ,n) and (γ,2n)-reaction rates have been simultaneously calculated in order to evaluate the feasibility of photonuclear transmutation using the (γ,n)-reaction. It has been shown that careful optimization of the LCS spectrum noticeably enhances the (γ,n)-reaction rate without requiring any isotopic separation of the iodine and cesium targets. Furthermore, in order to enhance the energy efficiency of the LCS-based photo-transmutation system, a novel multiple laser-Compton scattering extraction (MULEX) concept has been introduced in this work, and it has been shown that the total production of the LCS photons can easily be increased by a factor of 10 or 20 in a single accelerator system.},

	abstract = {As a nation develops its nuclear strategies, it must consider various aspects of nuclear energy such as sustainability, environmental-friendliness, proliferation-resistance, economics, technologies, and so on. A nuclear fuel cycle study could give convincing answers to many questions in regard to technical aspects. However, one nuclear fuel cycle option cannot be superior in all aspects. Therefore a nation must identify its top priority and accordingly evaluate all the possible nuclear fuel cycle options. For such a purpose, this paper examined four different fuel cycle options that are likely to be plausible under situation of Republic of Korea: once-through cycle, DUPIC recycling, thermal recycling using MOX fuel in PWR (pressurized water reactor), and SFR (sodium cooled fast reactor) employing fuel recycling by a pyroprocess. The options have been quantitatively compared in terms of resource utilization and waste generation based on 1 TWh electricity production at a “steady-state” condition as a basic analysis. This investigation covered from the front-end of the fuel cycles to the final disposal and showed that the Pyro-SFR recycling appears to be the most competitive from these material quantitative aspects due to the reduction of the required uranium resources and the least amount of waste generation.},

	abstract = {The potential benefits of a synergistic light-water reactor (LWR) and gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR) fuel cycle were evaluated for its impact on the front-end and back-end of the fuel cycle. Comparisons were made with conventional once-through cycle (OTC) and MOX fuel cycle. Variations in the synergistic LWR/GFR fuel cycles were based on the degree of recycle in the LWR including both plutonium and reprocessed uranium with concomitant impact on used LWR fuel inventory. This provided a wide range in composition of GFR feed from low to high plutonium content with impact on transmutation/incineration within the GFR fuel cycle. Self-recycle of all actinides was modeled for the GFR with analyses demonstrating that the GFR can be sustained on and consequently accept a wide range of feed materials. Analyses were done using Monteburns along with MCNP and Origen2.2 to model a 60-year period corresponding to the anticipated lifetime of supposed contemporary LWRs and GFRs. All cycles were evaluated based on actinide total mass and isotopic inventory, radiotoxicity, heatload, and resource requirements including natural uranium and SWU. For comparison, all fuel cycles were normalized based on 1 TWHe output. Improvements in fuel cycle performance are dictated by the production and incineration of minor actinides in the GFR and their continued recycle may not be feasible due to the buildup of troublesome isotopes such as 244Cm and 252Cf. But where uranium and plutonium continue to be recycled beyond the 60-year period, the LWR/GFR cycles demonstrated order of magnitude reductions in used fuel inventories, heatload, and radiotoxicity on a per TWHe basis over LWR only cycles. The full details of the advanced fuel cycle methodology and results are presented.},

Using the method of “essential differences account” (EDA) these factors are compared for two hypothetical plants of equal capacity, using technology provided currently in the uranium enrichment market: the Russian and the West European. The analysis is performed of two parameters that affect the choice of separation technology: 1) the cost of the plant installed capacity, reflecting the capital cost of its construction, and 2) the financial loss due to failure probability of centrifuges in operation, affecting the plant operating costs. It is shown that the main differences in construction costs depend on the characteristics of the gas centrifuge (GC) used. It is also shown that the costs associated with the failed centrifuges replacement are mainly determined by the individual characteristics of centrifuges. The estimates made on the basis of available information show a clear advantage of one of the two considered technological platforms.},

In aggregate, reactor-oriented categories (five in all) comprise 45.5\% of publications. The US is the most dominant thorium-publishing nation with 916 publications, followed next by India with 82 and then eight other countries having 25 publications or more. National laboratories have contributed 45\% of thorium publications, with roughly equal shares of the balance split between government agencies, universities, and corporations/companies. Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US accounts for more than a quarter of all publications. Specialized criteria are developed and applied to identify some of the most important, or “keystone”, publications for each category. Across the different categories, and for the study of thorium fuel cycles overall, published research reached an intermediate peak in the 1970s followed by a sharp decline in the 1980s and 1990s; however, interest has been revived moving into the 21st century.},

	doi = {http://dx.doi.org/10.13182/NSE14-135},
	abstract = {For a reactor to establish a sustainable breed-and-burn (B\&B) mode of operation, its fuel has to reach a minimum level of average burnup. The value of the minimum required average discharge burnup strongly depends on the core design details. Using the extended neutron balance method, it is possible to quantify the impact of major core design choices on the minimum required burnup in a B\&B core. Relevant design variables include the fuel chemical form, nonactinide mass fraction of metallic fuel, feed-fuel fissile fraction, fuel rod pitch-to-diameter ratio (P/D), average neutron flux level, and fraction of neutron loss. Metallic fuels have been found to be the only viable fuel options for a realistic near-term B\&B reactor. For the core designs we have studied, it was not possible to sustain B\&B operation using oxide fuel that is not enriched, while nitride and carbide fuels may only work in highly ideal low-leakage systems at very high levels of discharge burnup and, hence, neutron irradiation damage. The minimum required burnup increases strongly with the total fraction of neutrons that is lost to leakage and reactivity control. The flux level has no effect on the neutron balance within the applicable range, and the average discharge burnup is also relatively insensitive to the fraction of fissile material in the feed fuel in the range from depleted uranium (0.2\% 235U) to natural uranium (0.71\% 235U). The minimum required burnup is most sensitive, in order of importance, to the fractional loss of neutrons, the Zr content in metallic fuel, and the fuel rod P/D. Changing the weight fraction of zirconium in metallic fuel by 1\% (for example, from 10\% to 9\%) gives the same change in required discharge burnup as adjusting the P/D by 0.02 (for example, from 1.10 to 1.12).},

	abstract = {The Republic of Korea (ROK) was operating 24 nuclear power plants (NPPs) at the end of 2015 and nearly 30\% of electricity was supplied by the fleet of NPPs. Currently, spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from the NPPs is stored in pools attached to each NPP. However, the pools have been gradually filling up and would be saturated within decades. Recently, The Public Engagement Commission on Spent Nuclear Fuel Management (PECOS) submitted its final report to government proposing direct disposal of SNF from the early 2050s. It also suggested construction of an interim storage facility at the same site. In this work, the amount of SNF was quantified based on various nuclear scenarios. National electricity plans address the installed capacity of nuclear to 2035. To extend the period of the scenarios up to 2100, the results of open research were adopted and nine sub-scenarios were derived, considering the prospect for electricity demand (highest, reference and lowest) as well as the lifetime extension of NPPs. The total amount of SNF was estimated at between 60 and 102ktHM at 2100. The required at-reactor (AR) storage capacity was evaluated within a range of 10–12ktHM and an away-from-reactor (AFR) facility would store 14–17ktHM depending on the scenarios.},

The improved method is applied to calculate sensitivity coefficients and uncertainties of eigenvalue responses for UO2 and MOX (ThO2–UO2 and PuO2–UO2) fueled pressurized water reactor cells. The verification of the improved method was performed by comparing the sensitivities with MCNP6 and TSUNAMI-1D. For uncertainty, calculation comparisons were done with TSUNAMI-1D, and we demonstrate that the differences are caused by the use of different covariance matrices.},

Recently a major deficiency in numerical stability of existing Monte Carlo coupling schemes was identified. Alternative, stable coupling schemes were derived, implemented and verified. These methods are iterative and rely on either the end- or middle-of-step (MOS) reaction rates to evaluate the end-of-step (EOS) nuclide densities. Here, we demonstrate that applying the EOS methods for realistic problems may lead to highly inaccurate results. Considerable improvement can be made by adopting MOS method but the accuracy may still be insufficient. The solution proposed in this work relies on the substep method that allows reducing the time discretization errors. The proposed and tested substep method also assumes that the reaction rates are linear functions of the logarithm of the nuclide densities. The method was implemented in BGCore code and subsequently used to perform a series of test case calculations. The results demonstrate that better accuracy and hence efficiency can be achieved with negligible additional computational burden.},

Based on the fuel management strategy, the spent-fuel characteristics for employed fuel types were assessed, including radiotoxicity, decay heat and gamma rays.

The general nature of the matrix exponential method permits the treatment of complex decay and transmutation schemes.  An extensive library of nuclear data has been compiled, including half-lives and decay schemes, neutron absorbtion, cross sections, fission yields, disintegration energies, and multigroup photon release data.  ORIGEN has been used to compute the compositions and radiactivity of fission products, cladding materials, and fuel materials in LWRs, LMFBRs, MSBRs, and HTGRs.  The applications are illustrated with calculated inventories and radiation levels for spent fuel irradiated to a burnup of 33,000 MWd/metric ton in a PWR spectrum.},

Especially in the light of the different roadmap exercises that have been undertaken in the past years indicating the need for symbiotic nuclear energy systems in the longer term. The symbiosis between different nuclear reactor types and their associated fuel cycle should fulfill competing objectives for such systems, i.e. economics, environmental friendliness, resource longevity, waste management, and non-proliferation. A new code, dubbed DANESS, has been developed which allows performing such dynamic analysis of nuclear energy systems composed of multiple reactors and fuel cycle options including cross-flow of fissile material between the different components of the system. Today, the code allows mass-flow analysis and economics and is currently being extended to include life-cycle analysis data, non-proliferation metrics and non-nuclear energy sources. This paper will describe the main features of this code and will indicate the possible uses and future developments.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycles (NFC) are the collection of interconnected processes
which generate electricity through nuclear power. Due to the high degree of
coupling between components even in the simplest cycles, the need for a dynamic
fuel cycle simulator and analysis framework arises. The work presented
herein develops essential physics models of nuclear power reactors and incorporate
them into a NFC simulation framework.
First, a one-energy group reactor model is demonstrated. This essential
physics model is then to simulate a sampling fuel cycles which are perturbations
of well known base-case cycles. Because the NFC may now be simulated
quickly, stochastically modeling many fuel cycle realizations dramatically expands
the parameter space which may be analyzed. Finally, a multigroup
reactor model which incorporates spectral changes as a function of burnup is
presented to increase the fidelity of the original one-group reactor.
These methods form a suite of modeling technologies which reach from
the lowest levels (individual components) to the highest (inter-cycle comparisons). Prior to the development of this model suite, such broad-ranging analysis
had been unrealistic to perform. The work here thus presents a new,
multi-scale approach to fuel cycle system design.},

	url = {http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/79025},
	abstract = {For decades, nuclear energy development was based on the expectation that recycling of the fissionable materials in the used fuel from today's light water reactors into advanced (fast) reactors would be implemented as soon as technically feasible in order to extend the nuclear fuel resources. More recently, arguments have been made for deployment of fast reactors in order to reduce the amount of higher actinides, hence the longevity of radioactivity, in the materials destined to a geologic repository. The cost of the fast reactors, together with concerns about the proliferation of the technology of extraction of plutonium from used LWR fuel as well as the large investments in construction of reprocessing facilities have been the basis for arguments to defer the introduction of recycling technologies in many countries including the US. In this thesis, the impacts of alternative reactor technologies on the fuel cycle are assessed. Additionally, metrics to characterize the fuel cycles and systematic approaches to using them to optimize the fuel cycle are presented. The fuel cycle options of the 2010 MIT fuel cycle study are re-examined in light of the expected slower rate of growth in nuclear energy today, using the CAFCA (Code for Advanced Fuel Cycle Analysis). The Once Through Cycle (OTC) is considered as the base-line case, while advanced technologies with fuel recycling characterize the alternative fuel cycle options available in the future. The options include limited recycling in LWRs and full recycling in fast reactors and in high conversion LWRs. Fast reactor technologies studied include both oxide and metal fueled reactors. Additional fuel cycle scenarios presented for the first time in this work assume the deployment of innovative recycling reactor technologies such as the Reduced Moderation Boiling Water Reactors and Uranium-235 initiated Fast Reactors. A sensitivity study focused on system and technology parameters of interest has been conducted to test the robustness of the conclusions presented in the MIT Fuel Cycle Study. These conclusions are found to still hold, even when considering alternative technologies and different sets of simulation assumptions. Additionally, a first of a kind optimization scheme for the nuclear fuel cycle analysis is proposed and the applications of such an optimization are discussed. Optimization metrics of interest for different stakeholders in the fuel cycle (economics, fuel resource utilization, high level waste, transuranics/proliferation management, and environmental impact) are utilized for two different optimization techniques: a linear one and a stochastic one. Stakeholder elicitation provided sets of relative weights for the identified metrics appropriate to each stakeholder group, which were then successfully used to arrive at optimum fuel cycle configurations for recycling technologies. The stochastic optimization tool, based on a genetic algorithm, was used to identify non-inferior solutions according to Pareto's dominance approach to optimization. The main tradeoff for fuel cycle optimization was found to be between economics and most of the other identified metrics.},

	abstract = {The use of passive gamma and neutron signatures from fission indicators is a common means of estimating used fuel burnup, enrichment, and cooling time. However, while characteristic fission product signatures such as 134Cs, 137Cs, 154Eu, and others are generally reliable estimators for used fuel burnup within the context where the assembly initial enrichment and the discharge time are known, in the absence of initial enrichment and/or cooling time information (such as when applying NDA measurements in a safeguards/verification context), these fission product indicators no longer yield a unique solution for assembly enrichment, burnup, and cooling time after discharge. Through the use of a new Mesh-Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm, it is possible to directly probe the shape of this “degeneracy space” characteristic of individual nuclides (and combinations thereof), both as a function of constrained parameters (such as the assembly irradiation history) and unconstrained parameters (e.g., the cooling time before measurement and the measurement precision for particular indicator nuclides). In doing so, this affords the identification of potential means of narrowing the uncertainty space of potential assembly enrichment, burnup, and cooling time combinations, thereby bounding estimates of assembly plutonium content. In particular, combinations of gamma-emitting nuclides with distinct half-lives (e.g., 134Cs with 137Cs and 154Eu) in conjunction with gross neutron counting (via 244Cm) are able to reasonably constrain the degeneracy space of possible solutions to a space small enough to perform useful discrimination and verification of fuel assemblies based on their irradiation history.},

Alternative nuclear technologies have been suggested as a means of delivering enhanced sustainability with proposals including fast reactors, the use of thorium fuel and tiered fuel cycles. The debate as to which is the most appropriate technology continues, with each fuel system and reactor type delivering specific advantages and disadvantages which can be difficult to compare fairly. This paper demonstrates a framework of performance metrics which, coupled with a first-order lumped reactor model to determine nuclide population balances, can be used to quantify the aforementioned pros and cons for a range of different fuel and reactor combinations. The framework includes metrics such as fuel efficiency, spent fuel toxicity and proliferation resistance, and relative cycle performance is analysed through parallel coordinate plots, yielding a quantitative comparison of disparate cycles.},

The text then proceeds to class design, including the proper use of constructors, destructors, and overloaded operator functions for assignment within classes. (These guidelines ensure that you will create custom C++ classes that are fully functional data types, which can be copied and assigned just like built-in C++ classes.){\textless}p{\textgreater} The author also provides a handful of suggestions for general class design, including strategies for using different types of inheritance and encapsulation. Never doctrinaire and always intelligent, these guidelines can make your C++ classes more robust and easier to maintain. {\textless}I{\textgreater}–Richard Dragan{\textless}/I{\textgreater} I wrote the original edition of Effective C++ in 1991. When the time came for a second edition in 1997, I updated the material in important ways, but, because I didn't want to confuse readers familiar with the first edition, I did my best to retain the existing structure: 48 of the original 50 Item titles remained essentially unchanged. If the book were a house, the second edition was the equivalent of freshening things up by replacing carpets, paint, and light fixtures. For the third edition, I tore the place down to the studs. (There were times I wished I'd gone all the way to the foundation.) The world of C++ has undergone enormous change since 1991, and the goal of this book -; to identify the most important C++ programming guidelines in a small, readable package -; was no longer served by the Items I'd established nearly 15 years earlier. In 1991, it was reasonable to assume that C++ programmers came from a C background. Now, programmers moving to C++ are just as likely to come from Java or C\#. In 1991, inheritance and object-oriented programming were new to most programmers. Now they're well-established concepts, and exceptions, templates, and generic programming are the areas where people need more guidance. In 1991, nobody had heard of design patterns. Now it's hard to discuss software systems without referring to them. In 1991, work had just begun on a formal standard for C++. Now that standard is eight years old, and work has begun on the next version. To address these changes, I wiped the slate as clean as I could and asked myself, What are the most important pieces of advice for practicing C++ programmers in 2005? The result is the set of Items in this new edition. The book has new chapters on resource management and on programming with templates. In fact, template concerns are woven throughout the text, because they affect almost everything in C++. The book also includes new material on programming in the presence of exceptions, on applying design patterns, and on using the new TR1 library facilities. (TR1 is described in Item54.) It acknowledges that techniques and approaches that work well in single-threaded systems may not be appropriate in multithreaded systems. Well over half the material in the book is new. However, most of the fundamental information in the second edition continues to be important, so I found a way to retain it in one form or another. (You'll find a mapping between the second and third edition Items in Appendix B.) I've worked hard to make this book as good as I can, but I have no illusions that it's perfect. If you feel that some of the Items in this book are inappropriate as general advice; that there is a better way to accomplish a task examined in the book; or that one or more of the technical discussions is unclear, incomplete, or misleading, please tell me. If you find an error of any kind -; technical, grammatical, typographical, whatever -; please tell me that, too. I'll gladly add to the acknowledgments in later printings the name of the first person to bring each problem to my attention. Even with the number of Items expanded to 55, the set of guidelines in this book is far from exhaustive. But coming up with good rules -; ones that apply to almost all applications almost all the time -; is harder than it might seem. If you have suggestions for additional guidelines, I would be delighted to hear about them. I maintain a list of changes to this book since its first printing, including bug fixes, clarifications, and technical updates.

	abstract = {Abstract
The options for used nuclear fuel storage location and affected parameters such as economic liabilities are currently a focus of several high level studies. A variety of nuclear fuel cycle system analysis models are available for such a task. The application of nuclear fuel cycle system dynamics models for waste management options is important to life-cycle impact assessment.

The recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Committee on America’s Nuclear Future led to increased focus on long periods of spent fuel storage [1]. This motivated further investigation of the location dependency of used nuclear fuel in the parameters of economics, environmental impact, and proliferation risk.

Through a review of available literature and interactions with each of the programs available, comparisons of post-reactor fuel storage and handling options will be evaluated based on the aforementioned parameters and a consensus of preferred system metrics and boundary conditions will be provided. Specifically, three options of local, regional, and national storage were studied. The preliminary product of this research is the creation of a system dynamics tool known as the Waste Management Module (WMM) which provides an easy to use interface for education on fuel cycle waste management economic impacts. Initial results of baseline cases point to positive benefits of regional storage locations with local regional storage options continuing to offer the lowest cost.},

NFCSim is an ideal tool for analysis - of the economics, sustainability, or proliferation resistance - of nonequilibrium, interacting, or evolving reactor fleets. The software couples with a criticality and burnup engine, LACE (Los Alamos Criticality Engine). LACE implements a piecewise-linear, reactor-specific reactivity model for its criticality calculations. This model constructs fluence-dependent reactivity traces for any facility; it is designed to address nuclear economies in which either a steady state is never obtained or is a poor approximation. LACE operates in transient and equilibrium fuel management regimes at the refueling batch level, derives reactor- and cycle-dependent initial fuel compositions, and invokes ORIGEN2.x to carry out burnup calculations.},

Prior to establishing a national R\&D programme, the Government commissioned the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) and the Dalton Nuclear Institute (DNI) to lead a preliminary R\&D programme to fill in some gaps that have been identified. This initial R\&D included a programme of work on Strategic Assessment, which will look at possible future energy and nuclear deployment scenarios to identify the important constraints and limitations. The nuclear expansion scenarios envisage a new build programme based on a Light Water Reactor (LWR) fleet and in some of these scenarios the LWRs are at some point replaced by a fleet of fast reactors with recycle that would allow a self-sustaining fuel cycle independent of world uranium supplies. This paper focuses on the high level conclusions that arise from the fast reactor scenarios studied. The high level conclusions relate to constraints on timescales for expansion of nuclear capacity and technical specifications for fuel cycle and waste management plants. In particular the work illustrates how the driving factors for fast reactor deployment have changed since the UK was last involved seriously in fast reactor development work in the mid-1990s.},

	abstract = {Benchmarking of the economics methodologies developed by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) and the International Atomic Energy Agency’s International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO), was performed for three Generation IV nuclear energy systems. The Economic Modeling Working Group of GIF developed an Excel based spreadsheet package, G4ECONS (Generation 4 Excel-based Calculation Of Nuclear Systems), to calculate the total capital investment cost (TCIC) and the levelised unit energy cost (LUEC). G4ECONS is sufficiently generic in the sense that it can accept the types of projected input, performance and cost data that are expected to become available for Generation IV systems through various development phases and that it can model both open and closed fuel cycles. The Nuclear Energy System Assessment (NESA) Economic Support Tool (NEST) was developed to enable an economic analysis using the INPRO methodology to easily calculate outputs including the TCIC, LUEC and other financial figures of merit including internal rate of return, return of investment and net present value. NEST is also Excel based and can be used to evaluate nuclear reactor systems using the open fuel cycle, MOX (mixed oxide) fuel recycling and closed cycles.

A Super Critical Water-cooled Reactor system with an open fuel cycle and two Fast Reactor systems, one with a break-even fuel cycle and another with a burner fuel cycle, were selected for the benchmarking exercise. Published data on capital and operating costs were used for economics analyses using G4ECONS and NEST tools. Both G4ECONS and NEST predicted comparable TCIC and LUEC; with some variation in fuel cycle costs. The benchmarking exercise was also useful to understand the differences in the two methodologies for potential harmonisation opportunities in the future.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this work is to present a new methodology, and associated computational tools, developed within the U.S. Department of Energy Fuel Cycle Option Campaign to quantify the economic performance of complex nuclear fuel cycles. The levelized electricity cost at the busbar is generally chosen to quantify and compare the economic performance of different baseload generating technologies, including of nuclear: it is the cost of electricity which renders the risk-adjusted discounted net present value of the investment cash flow equal to zero. The work presented here is focused on the calculation of the levelized cost of electricity of fuel cycles at mass balance equilibrium, which is termed LCAE (Levelized Cost of Electricity at Equilibrium). To alleviate the computational issues associated with the calculation of the LCAE for complex fuel cycles, a novel approach has been developed, which has been called the "island approach " because of its logical structure: a generic complex fuel cycle is subdivided into subsets of fuel cycle facilities, called islands, each containing one and only one type of reactor or blanket and an arbitrary number of fuel cycle facilities. A nuclear economic software tool, NE-COST, written in the commercial programming software MATLAB®, has been developed to calculate the LCAE of complex fuel cycles with the "island" computational approach. NE-COST has also been developed with the capability to handle uncertainty: the input parameters (both unit costs and fuel cycle characteristics) can have uncertainty distributions associated with them, and the output can be computed in terms of probability density functions of the LCAE. In this paper NE-COST will be used to quantify, as examples, the economic performance of (1) current LWR once-through systems; (2) continuous Pu recycling in fast reactors with driver and blanket (FR); (3) Recycling of Pu bred in FR into LWR. For each fuel cycle, the contributions to the total LCAE of the main cost components will be identified.},

	abstract = {A global economy and increase in customer expectations in terms of cost and services have put a premium on effective supply chain reengineering. It is essential to perform risk-benefit analysis of reengineering alternatives before making a final decision. Simulation provides an effective pragmatic approach to detailed analysis and evaluation of supply chain design and management alternatives. However, the utility of this methodology is hampered by the time and effort required to develop models with sufficient fidelity to the actual supply chain of interest. In this paper, we describe a supply chain modeling framework designed to overcome this difficulty. Using our approach, supply chain models are composed from software components that represent types of supply chain agents (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, transporters), their constituent control elements (e.g., inventory policy), and their interaction protocols (e.g., message types). The underlying library of supply chain modeling components has been derived from analysis of several different supply chains. It provides a reusable base of domain-specific primitives that enables rapid development of customized decision support tools.},

	abstract = {An investigation was performed to assess the feasibility of passive gamma-ray spectrometry assay as an approach for on-line burnup determination for the Modular Pebble Bed Reactor (MPBR). In addition to its inherently safe design, a unique feature of this reactor is its multipass fuel cycle in which graphite fuel pebbles are randomly loaded and continuously circulated through the core until they reach their prescribed end-of-life burnup limit (/spl sim/80 000 MWD/MTU). Unlike the situation with conventional light water reactors, depending solely on computational methods to perform in-core fuel management will be highly inaccurate. As a result, an on-line measurement approach becomes the only accurate method to assess whether a particular pebble has reached its end-of-life burnup limit. The results of this investigation indicate that the fission products Cs-137 and Eu-154 have the potential to provide accurate and power-history-resistant signatures that can be directly correlated with burnup. Furthermore, depending on the fuel manufacturing process, artificially introduced dopants (e.g., Co) can provide gamma-ray lines that are usable for burnup monitoring. In fact, it was found that the relative activity of Co-60 to Cs-134 could form a burnup indicator that is resistant to power-history variations. In this case, the use of a relative indicator has several advantages, among them the elimination of the need for absolute knowledge of the detector full-energy peak efficiency curve and the establishment of a system quality-assurance figure of merit based on the peak area ratio of the Co lines.},

	abstract = {In 2007 the UK government's public consultation on the future of nuclear power courted much criticism. Three studies were conducted to assess whether key arguments used by government within this consultation might have influenced public opinion about the technology. Participants first read a passage of text that made salient certain positive (climate change mitigation, increased energy security) or negative (nuclear waste) aspects of the nuclear debate. Participants then completed a task that required them to create an electricity mix for the UK by varying the contributions made by each of five energy sources (coal, gas, nuclear, renewables and electric import). Study 1 seemed to indicate that pitching the debate in terms of climate change mitigation was effective in increasing endorsement of nuclear power. The results of studies 2 and 3, however, contested this conclusion, suggesting that these arguments were having little direct impact upon participants' preferences for nuclear power. The results of these studies hold implications for UK energy policy and attitude assessment and can contribute to the understanding of how the arguments used by government in the 2007 consultation might have influenced public opinion.},

	abstract = {Why since 1945 have nuclear weapons not been used? Political scientists have cited five basic reasons: deterrence, practicality, precedent, reputation, and ethics. Scholars attempting to weight these factors face a dearth of empirical data. Declassified records of political-military wargames played by U.S. policymakers, however, open up new avenues for theory testing. An investigation of the willingness of U.S. “strategic elites”—experts with experience in diplomatic or military strategy—to use nuclear weapons in a sample of twenty-six political-military wargames reveals that elite players were reluctant to cross the nuclear threshold against both nuclear-armed and nonnuclear-armed adversaries. The only uses of nuclear weapons in the sample occurred in two wargames with nuclear adversaries. Players’ arguments for restraint in the wargames invoked reputational aversion: decisionmakers feared the opprobrium they would face if they used nuclear weapons. Wargame records also strongly support the power of deterrence and basic practicality—whether conventional weapons could accomplish the same goals—as reasons for widespread hesitation to use nuclear weapons. Precedent and ethical aversions to using nuclear weapons were less common. Finally, players also demonstrated some conformity to what they thought the president expected of them.},

	abstract = {The need for a secure and sustainable energy future has become firmly entrenched on the global political agenda. Governments worldwide are seeking solutions that will ensure security of their energy supplies, while reducing carbon emissions in the fight against climate change. Advocates of nuclear power have reframed the technology as the most reliable, cost-effective and immediate solution to both of these policy problems, and predicted the emergence of a 'nuclear renaissance’. However, there is little evidence to date that suggests a nuclear renaissance has actually taken place. Public opinion polling demonstrates that many remain unconvinced of the need for nuclear power. This paper uses Cultural Theory as a heuristic to understand why the arguments for a nuclear renaissance have been largely unsuccessful. It argues that the failure of nuclear advocates to engage with a wider cross-section of world-views has prevented the controversy surrounding nuclear power from being resolved, and the nuclear renaissance from becoming a reality. In doing so, this paper builds upon a growing recognition of the contribution that social science research can make to understanding public acceptance of energy policy choices.},

	abstract = {In 2001 a new Land Law was adopted in Cambodia. It was significant because – for the first time – it recognised a new legal category of people, ‘Indigenous Peoples’ or chuncheat daoem pheak tech in Khmer, and it also introduced the legal concept of communal land rights to Cambodia. Indigenous Peoples are not mentioned in the 1993 constitution of Cambodia or any legislation pre-dating the 2001 Land Law. However, Cambodia's 2002 Forestry Law also followed the trend by recognising ‘Indigenous Peoples’. These laws have been both symbolically and practically important, as they have provided government-mandated legitimacy to Indigenous identities and associated land and forest rights, including communal land rights, and have been ontologically significant in dividing Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples on legal grounds. Over a decade after the 2001 Land Law was promulgated, this article considers some aspects of its effects. In particular, when compared with the potential for developing communal land rights in Laos, one has to wonder how advantageous it is to adopt Indigenous identities and the types of communal land rights and community forestry rights presently possible in Cambodia.},

	url = {https://github.com/gtw2/ms-thesis},
	abstract = {As a result of the once-through fuel cycle implemented in the US, used nuclear fuel (UNF) steadily increases. One proposed solution is the transition to a closed nuclear fuel cycle, in which reprocessing reduces build up of UNF. Pyroprocessing is an attractive method for this transition for its capabilities separating both light water reactor (LWR) and metallic fuels, and inherent proliferation resistance. However, unlike aqueous reprocessing plants, industrial pyroprocessing plants do not yet exist. Similar
to safety-by-design in next-generation reactors, reprocessing facilities could be designed with safeguards in mind via safeguards-by-design. Without operational experience, these safeguards-by-design need to be derived through modeling and simulation. 

This thesis develops a medium fidelity generic model, Pyre, capable of simulating a variety of pyroprocessing facility configurations. Pyre also simulates diversion via a diverter class capable of tracking signatures and observables. Rather than only tracking exact material production, we use signatures and observables such as operating temperature, pressure, and current to mimic the capabilities of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and aid identification of nefarious fuel cycles, or shadow fuel cycles.

These capabilities are verified in a transition scenario of the current US fuel cycle to a sodium fast reactor (SFR) based closed fuel cycle. Key operating parameters are determined through
sensitivity analysis of this scenario, monitoring isotopic changes in material unaccounted for. This work concludes that facility parameters which increase interaction between the salt and waste have more impact on material unaccounted for (MUF). This work also expands the state of the art by exploring the use of sub-facility modeling to increase fuel cycle fidelity.},

	abstract = {International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards designed to deter nuclear proliferation are constantly evolving to respond to new challenges. Within its State Level Concept, the IAEA envisions an objective-based and information-driven approach for designing and implementing State Level Approaches (SLAs), using all available measures to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards. The main objectives of a SLA are a) to detect undeclared nuclear material or activities in the State, b) to detect undeclared production or processing of nuclear materials in declared facilities or locations outside facilities (LOFs), c) to detect diversion of declared nuclear material in declared facilities or LOFs. Under the SLA, States will be differentiated based upon objective State-Specific Factors that influence the design, planning, conduct and evaluation of safeguards activities. Proposed categories of factors include both technical and legal aspects, spanning from the deployed fuel cycle and the related state's technical capability to the type of safeguards agreements in force and the IAEA experience in implementing safeguards in that state. To design a SLA, the IAEA foresees the use of Acquisition Path Analysis (APA) to identify the plausible routes for acquiring weapons-usable material and to assess their safeguards significance. In order to achieve this goal, APA will have to identify possible acquisition paths, characterize them and eventually prioritise them. This paper will provide an overview of how the use of open source information (here loosely defined as any type of non-classified or proprietary information and including, but not limited to, media sources, government and non-governmental reports and analyses, commercial data, satellite imagery, scientific/technical literature, trade data) can support this activity in selected aspects of a typical APA approach.},

informed by an analysis of all technically plausible paths by which the State could pursue

potential acquisition paths may involve diversion of declared nuclear material, misuse of
declared nuclear facilities for undeclared production or processing of nuclear material,
undeclared import of nuclear material, establishment and operation of undeclared nuclear
facilities, or combinations of these strategies. Each path step, and by extension each
potential acquisition path, is assessed in terms of the ease and speed with which the State
could accomplish, it in light the IAEA’s analysis of information about the State’s nuclear
fuel cycle and related technical capabilities. This in turn can guide the setting of priorities
for safeguards coverage of acquisition paths, including the establishment of timeliness
goals. This paper discusses work funded by DOE/NNSA’s Next Generation Safeguards
Initiative to explore, including via case studies, practical methods for assessing and

	abstract = {The objective of acquisition path analysis is to identify and assess all plausible routes by which a State
could, from a technical point of view, acquire nuclear material for the development of a nuclear
weapon or other nuclear explosive device. Each acquisition path consists of a series of acquisition
path steps that could include the diversion of nuclear material from declared nuclear facilities in the
State, misuse of declared facilities to process and produce undeclared nuclear material, and the
possible existence in the State of undeclared nuclear material, facilities and activities. Acquisition
path analysis includes the consideration of a State’s nuclear fuel cycle related capabilities and
experience, as well as additional capabilities and expertise that would be required by the State; it is
therefore a key aspect in the evaluation of all safeguards relevant information about a State. The
implementation of safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (‘IAEA’) will be based on
a customized State-level safeguards approach developed for each State. In addition to its use for State
evaluation, acquisition path analysis also provides the basis for the development of an effective Statelevel approach for States with comprehensive safeguards agreements in force. In order to ensure
comprehensive and consistent analysis for the development of State-level approaches, additional
internal guidance on acquisition path analysis has been prepared by the IAEA. This paper gives an
overview of the acquisition path analysis process, including how to identify and assess paths, and how
the results of the analysis can be used in the development of a State-level safeguards approach.},

	abstract = {This article studies the unexpected effects of international human rights instruments when appropriated by grassroots actors. International Labor Organization Convention No. 169 asserts that indigenous peoples have a right to consultation prior to approval of natural resource development projects that may affect them. In Guatemala, this right has become a crucial political tool for indigenous people, who make up half the population. Employing qualitative methods, this article analyzes how hundreds of indigenous communities in Guatemala have used a self-constructed legal and contentious political strategy to exercise the right to consultation, with little state support. The article argues that, although community consultations have failed to block any unwanted projects, they have altered indigenous peoples' conceptions of their identity, rights, and the state. The consultations have also transformed community governance practices but have led to new forms of social exclusion within communities, casting doubt on the democratic potential of the right to consultation. At the national scale, the consultations have helped unite an ideologically and spatially divided indigenous movement, potentially transforming postconflict Guatemalan politics. The article adds to our knowledge of how consultations unfold in practice and the social, political and cultural impacts they may have at the local and national scales.},

	abstract = {Relocations of indigenous peoples from protected areas to promote wildlife conservation have typically resulted in negative socioeconomic results for those displaced. The international indigenous peoples’ movement has begun to coalesce around the use of free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) as a legal mechanism to prevent disadvantageous relocations. In 2006, India’s parliament passed the Forest Rights Act, which requires any village relocation of tribal people be conditional upon their FPIC. I used household surveys and qualitative interviews of relocated and forest (not-yet relocated) villagers from Melghat Tiger Reserve, Maharashtra, to examine (a) the extent to which putatively voluntary relocations were conditional upon FPIC and (b) how such relocations affect socioeconomic metrics and overall quality of life for those relocated. I found that while consent to relocate was mostly free, consent was not fully informed across the villages examined. The socioeconomic results indicate that relocated villagers make a trade-off, leaving a familiar, healthier environment for better access to modern services and employment. Finally, I found that forest villagers in favor of relocation emphasized how the social and economic costs of remaining in the forest had become greater due to the relocation of neighboring villages. This field study suggests that strong implementation of FPIC and state responsiveness post-relocation are both necessary to safeguard forest-dwelling people from disadvantageous relocations.},

Chapter Two studies community vulnerability in risk analysis task using multi-source data statistics. Chapter Three offers a thorough analysis of risk perception and psychosocial vulnerability in a health context, from a theoretical perspective, and based on current scientific evidence, in order to open research lines for both of these constructs, both separately and collectively. Chapter Four establishes a relationship between the consumption of drugs like cannabis, cocaine and designer drugs in young university and non-university populations with the young people's perception of risks associated with such consumption.

This article examines the recent public discussion in Finland, France, and the UK – three countries currently in the process of constructing or planning new nuclear power stations. To place the public discussion on nuclear power within the relationship between policy discourses and contexts, the article addresses three interrelated themes: the justifications and discursive strategies employed by nuclear advocates and critics, the similarities and differences in debates between the three countries, and the interaction between the country-specific state orientations and the argumentation concerning nuclear power. Drawing from documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews, the article identifies and analyses key discursive strategies and their use in the context of the respective state orientations: ‘technology-and-industry-know-best’ in Finland, ‘government-knows-best’ in France, and ‘markets-know-best’ in the UK. The nuclear debates illustrate subtle ongoing transformations in these orientations, notably in the ways in which the relations between markets, the state, and civil society are portrayed in the nuclear debates.},

	abstract = {Perceptions of trust have been identified as important in the risk communication process. This research is concerned with establishing the degree of trust non-experts in radiation place in various sources of information about different radiation hazards. Participants were asked directly about the degree to which they would trust information about radiation risks from a variety of sources, including a totally fictitious source included as a control. They were also asked about the degree to which they believed each source had a vested interest in misinforming the public about the risks from radiation, and the degree of knowledge they believed each source had about the risks from radiation. The results indicated that while perceptions of ‘vested interest’ and ‘degree of knowledge’ are important elements in determining levels of trust, neither by itself is sufficient to guarantee high degrees of trust in any given source. The fictitious source received a very high degree of knowledge rating. These findings are discussed in terms of the impact the name of a source alone can have on perceptions of trust in a risk information source, and implications for developing effective risk communication about radiation risks. © 1999 E \& FN Spon.},

	abstract = {This article investigates possible differential levels of trust in government regulation across five different risk contexts and the relationship between a number of concepts that might be thought of as comprising distinctive “dimensions” of trust. It appeared that how people perceive government and its policies toward risk regulation was surprisingly similar for each of the five risk cases. A principal-component analysis showed that the various trust items could best be described by two dimensions: a general trust dimension, which was concerned with a wide range of trust-relevant aspects, such as competence, care, fairness, and openness, and a scepticism component that reflects a sceptical view regarding how risk policies are brought about and enacted. Again, the results were surprisingly similar across the five risk cases, as the same solution was found in each of the different samples. It was also examined whether value similarity has an additional value in predicting trust in risk regulation, compared to the more conventional aspects of trust. Based on the two independent trust factors that were found in this study, a typology of trust is proposed that ranges from full trust to a deep type of distrust. It is argued that for a functioning society it could well be more suitable to have critical but involved citizens in many situations.},

We test this argument with data from a sample of 200 forest user groups in Bolivia and find broad empirical support for our propositions: Local monitoring can be an important predictor of forest governance performance, but focusing on monitoring alone can be misleading. Sometimes other aspects of the local governance system, such as self-organized rule making and sanctioning, are more important in explaining why some groups govern their forests more effectively than others. We also find that the more governance functions that communities decide to organize themselves, the more likely it is that local forests are sustained.},

Based on semi-structured interviews (n=91), focus group discussions (64 participants involved), and participant observation, we found that for over half a century rescaling efforts by the Chinese government shifted the focus to national level development planning, which led to the degradation of indigenous institutions that managed common pool pastoral systems in the region. However, we also highlight how local actors have used recent changes in government policies to revitalize traditional herding institutions.

	abstract = {Modernity has helped to popularize, and at the same time threaten, indigeneity. Anthropologists question both the validity of the concept of indigeneity and the wisdom of employing it as a political tool, but they are reluctant to deny it to local communities, whose use of the concept has become subject to study. The concept of indigenous knowledge is similarly faulted in favor of the hybrid products of modernity, and the idea of indigenous environmental knowledge and conservation is heatedly contested. Possibilities for alternate environmentalisms, and the combining of conservation and development goals, are being debated and tested in integrated conservation and development projects and extractive reserves. Anthropological understanding of both state and community agency is being rethought, and new approaches to the study of collaboration, indigenous rights movements, and violence are being developed. These and other current topics of interest involving indigenous peoples challenge anthropological theory as well as ethics and suggest the importance of analyzing the contradictions inherent in the coevolution of science, society, and environment.},

	abstract = {In environmental health science, the concept ‘uncertain risk’ refers to situations in which epistemic uncertainties prevent definitive statements about the presence or existence of risk. The concept is difficult for risk communication and may easily lead to miscommunications and misunderstanding. This research investigated how the concept of uncertain risk is understood by different societal groups. We conducted in-depth interviews with the general public (N = 40), and online open-ended questionnaires and online focus groups with scientists, policy makers and communication experts (N = 49). Results show that the understanding of ‘uncertain risk’ varied within and between groups. While at least some representatives of all groups described epistemic uncertainties, groups focused on different aspects of risk. That is, scientists based their descriptions only on uncertainties in risk assessment. Policy makers commonly indicated that these uncertainties caused uncertainty in risk management. Communication experts mainly gave general descriptions, but recognized aspects that were important for other groups. Representatives of the general public often described aspects that deviate from the scientific understanding, such as a lack of personal control. In risk communication, stating that ‘a risk cannot be excluded’ is not clear. Different associations and understanding have to be taken into account in risk communication. Explicating uncertainties may improve consistent understanding and foster a more balanced dialogue between different societal groups. Further (empirical) research is needed to demonstrate if and how explicating evidence and uncertainties in specific cases of uncertain risks improves understanding within and between groups.},

	abstract = {Since the 1970s, the template for Swedish nuclear waste management has been for industry to deliver “nuclear fuel safety” after first demonstrating to government authority how and where it can be achieved. In other words, nuclear fuel safety has been something to be publicly witnessed before it is decided whether or not industry should be allowed to carry on implementing its plans. From the outset, these industry plans encompassed the completion of the Swedish nuclear power programme itself, as this was made contingent upon a demonstrated solution to the waste problem. However, after a national referendum on the future of nuclear power in 1980, industrial progress in nuclear fuel safety became directly connected with a safe phase out of a 12-reactor programme within 25 years of its completion. As plans for such a phase out have in turn grown subject to indefinite postponement, and as opposition to nuclear power has progressively mellowed, so the nuclear industry's highly resilient nuclear fuel safety programme appears set again today to validate nuclear new build both at home and abroad. Drawing on studies of three specific management tools – safety analyses, EIA consultations and alternative “dialogue projects” – this article seeks to chart the unremitting and indomitable Swedish commitment to the mediation of nuclear waste management through industrial demonstration as this has withstood various attempts to introduce a greater element of public dialogue into the policy process in response to both siting conflicts and new environmental legislation.},

Canada as Canada’s plan for the safe long-term management of Canada’s used nuclear fuel.
NWMO is presently in the site selection phase for this project, with several areas across Ontario
under consideration but no site identified.
This document presents a preliminary description of an APM Deep Geological Repository for used
nuclear fuel (APM DGR). In this description, this facility is assumed to be located within the
boundaries of the Township of Huron-Kinloss, the Municipality of South Bruce, or the Municipality of
Central Huron, and within Saugeen Ojibway Nation (SON) traditional territory. This description is
provided in order to assist Ontario Power Generation (OPG) in preparing its response to the federal
Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada request for an updated analysis of the
cumulative environmental effects of the OPG DGR project, assuming an APM DGR were to be built
in one of these communities.
This document presents a description at a conceptual level for a deep geological repository facility
for used nuclear fuel. The description is based on what is known or reasonably expected at the
present time, assuming that a suitable site for a used fuel repository has been identified in one of
these three communities involved in the APM siting process. A definitive description would be
completed in the future if a site were actually to be selected, and the site, design, community input
and environmental assessments had been completed, consistent with NWMO’s siting process.
NWMO would not proceed without the involvement of the interested community, First Nation and
Métis communities, and surrounding communities working to implement the project.},

	abstract = {The article presents the framework of social amplification of risk which integrates the technical assessment and the social experience of risk. Risk perception research has revealed that contextual factors shape individual risk estimations and evaluations. Identification of these factors, such as voluntariness, personal ability to influence risks, familiarity with the hazard, and catastrophic potential, provides useful information about the elements that individuals consider in constructing their interpretation of risks. In addition, analyses of people's heuristics in making inferences have shed some light on how risk information is generalized and evaluated intuitively. These psychological studies fail to explain, however, why individuals attend to certain characteristics of risks and ignore others. Furthermore, in focusing only on the individual as an information processor, these studies exclude from the analysis the social and cultural variance of risk interpretations. The social amplification framework postulates that the social and economic impacts of an adverse event are determined not only by the direct physical consequences of the event, but by the interaction of psychological, cultural, social, and institutional processes that amplify or attenuate public experience of risk and result in secondary impacts.},

@article{perkel_lake_2017,
	address = {Toronto, Ontario, Canada},
	title = {Lake {Huron} site best suited for nuclear-waste bunker, report affirms},
	abstract = {A new report from Ontario Power Generation overwhelmingly affirms the utility's long-held position that the best place for a nuclear-waste bunker is on the Lake Huron shoreline.

One of the biggest problems with burying the hazardous waste somewhere else would come from having to truck it up to 2,000 kilometres, increasing the risk of radiological accidents and pollution, the 143-page analysis concludes.

The only minor advantage – amid a sea of disadvantages – to locating a bunker elsewhere might be less disturbance of Indigenous heritage sites, such as burial grounds, the report finds.

Even so, the overall impact on Aboriginal Peoples is likely to be lower if the deep geologic repository is built, as proposed, at the Bruce nuclear plant near Kincardine, Ont., the report states.

"There is the potential that the total risk may be increased on Indigenous peoples if the (facility) is constructed at an alternate location," the report states. "This (is) due to the introduction of a new facility in an area previously without a nuclear facility, as well as the transportation of wastes to that facility."

Alternative nuclear burial sites would be cost-prohibitive, adding anywhere from \$381-million to more than \$2-billion to the current cost projection of \$2.4-billion, the report states.

The new study comes in response to a request from the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, which has yet to make a final recommendation to Environment Minister Catherine McKenna on whether to approve the project. The agency, along with critics of the proposal, had slammed OPG's previous report on feasible alternative locations as superficial and inadequate.

The new study did not actually pinpoint any specific alternate sites. Instead, the analysis takes in large areas of the province that meet the minimal requirements for rock that would be geologically stable for centuries.

Scores of groups and communities in both Canada and the U.S., have decried the current plan to store the waste underground about 1.2 kilometres from Lake Huron. OPG's new report did little to assuage their concerns about the potential for catastrophic pollution of a major drinking-water source.

"OPG has not changed its position: proximity of the nuclear waste burial site to a Great Lake is not relevant, there is no need to investigate any other actual sites and OPG has a social licence to proceed," the group Stop The Great Lakes Nuclear Dump said in a statement.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT


By almost every measure, however, the new OPG report counters that concern, maintaining the stable bedrock at the Bruce plant would be the perfect storage site.

"Ideal geology exists for safely isolating nuclear waste 680 metres below ground in stable, dry rock," OPG said in a statement accompanying the report. "Alternate locations in the Canadian Shield or southwest Ontario, while technically feasible, would result in greater environmental effects and higher costs, as well as a project delay of 15 years or more, while offering no additional benefits in safety."

The utility does admit in the report to facing ongoing pushback to the plan from area First Nations, particularly the Saugeen Ojibway Nation, which has long complained about the presence of the nuclear plant. The report says OPG has promised it would not move ahead with the project without their support.

"For clarity and to avoid any confusion, OPG acknowledges that the affected Indigenous peoples have not accepted (the repository)," the report states. "OPG anticipates that through a respectful joint process and through accommodation, an acceptable outcome may be achieved."

The environmental assessment agency said it was reviewing the new information as it gets set to prepare a draft report, along with any conditions that OPG would have to meet if the project proceeds. The public will get a chance to comment on that report and conditions, the agency said.

In May 2015, an environmental review panel approved the repository but the federal government has since delayed its decision several times.},

	abstract = {The need for a secure and sustainable energy future has become ﬁrmly entrenched on the global political agenda. Governments worldwide are seeking solutions that will ensure security of their energy supplies, while reducing carbon emissions in the ﬁght against climate change. Advocates of nuclear power have reframed the technology as the most reliable, cost-effective and immediate solution to both of these policy problems, and predicted the emergence of a 'nuclear renaissance’. However, there is little evidence to date that suggests a nuclear renaissance has actually taken place. Public opinion polling demonstrates that many remain unconvinced of the need for nuclear power. This paper uses Cultural Theory as a heuristic to understand why the arguments for a nuclear renaissance have been largely unsuccessful. It argues that the failure of nuclear advocates to engage with a wider cross-section of world-views has prevented the controversy surrounding nuclear power from being resolved, and the nuclear renaissance from becoming a reality. In doing so, this paper builds upon a growing recognition of the contribution that social science research can make to understanding public acceptance of energy policy choices.},

Fourteen empirical studies of CACs involved in environmental policy decisions (spanning the period from 1976 to 1994) are reviewed here, including case studies, large-scale surveys, and consultant reports. For each study consideration is given to the methods of study, the issues considered by the CACs, the organizations advised, the definitions of success used in the study, and the suggested factors contributing to the success, or lack of success, experienced by the CACs. The review shows that the influence of CACs on policy outcomes have varied from case to case, with some accomplishing little and others having significant policy impacts. The increased use of CACs by government and industry presents an excellent opportunity for academics and practitioners to strengthen their understanding of the internal processes and capabilities of CACs through comparative evaluation research.},

The analyses of the two strategies were based on the costs of strategy implementation and the benefits from the reduction in accidents involving pre-1977 model year Pintos. The results indicated that the recall strategy was more cost-ineffective than the design modification strategy. Consideration was also given to a third risk response strategy which included no corrective action.},

Sensing this concern, politicians emphasize the threat of violent attacks to advance a platform of making public safety a priority. In this context, the authors assess the extent, sources, and emotional impact of the public’s concern about terrorism. On the basis of a national survey of 1,000 Americans, the authors examine levels of fear of a terrorist attack and worry about terrorism relative to other potential harms. They also determine whether concern about terrorism translates into support for homeland security measures that target Muslims. Of the predictors in the authors’ models, gender, religiosity, and psychological distress were most consistently associated with fear of terrorism and worry about being a victim of a terrorist attack. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that terrorism-related fear and worry predict support for anti-Muslim policies.},

	abstract = {Total body neutron activation analysis, prompt-gamma neutron activation analysis, and whole body counting have been used to determine the elemental composition of the human body. The total body elements measured were potassium, nitrogen, calcium, sodium, chlorine, and phosphorus. Total body water was also determined by the dilution principle using tritiated water. Observations were made in an adult US population that totaled 1374 and ranged in age from 20 to 90 yr. The dataset for the white population consisted of 175 males and 1134 females observations; for the black population, it consisted of 30 male and 35 female observations. The variation in the elemental composition of both males and females in any 5-yr age group was large and ranged up to 20\% (SD). Age-, race-, sex-, and size-specific differences were evident. When equations were developed that predicted the elemental composition of the adult on the basis of age, weight, and height, the variation in the age groups was reduced approximately in half. Age-specific mean values for the 20- to 29-yr-old white population were also compared with values for the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP)-23 Reference Man. The "average" young adult male was larger than Reference Man; the in vivo data also indicated a larger skeletal mass, more lean tissues and body water, but lower body sodium. When in vivo prediction equations were used to adjust for size differences, good agreement was found between the expected values and those for Reference Man. The ICRP-23 does not contain elemental data for Reference Woman; therefore, the in vivo data in the present study provide the first estimates of body composition for Reference Woman.},

This chapter starts by looking at the rocks to be tested: the cores in the laboratory may not be fully representative of the formation one intends to study. They may also have been altered during coring and subsequent handling. The chapter also discusses the laboratory equipment and measurement techniques applied in the rock mechanical testing, including also acoustic measurements. This chapter illustrates that in some cases it may be useful to perform a set of simpler measurements, which can be used as indicators of rock strength and stiffness. This can provide information at low cost and low material consumption. If performed at the rig-site, results may be available closer to real-time. Finally, this chapter concludes by describing some of these so-called index tests.},

These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors.

	abstract = {In this chapter, we report on three psychometric scaling studies, summarized in Table 1. In each study, participants rated a given set of hazards on a range of risk characteristics and indicated the degree of risk reduction and regulation they desired. Based on this data, we explore the relationships among risk characteristics and a smaller number of dimensions (factors) derived from them. We also relate risk characteristics to people's perception of risk and their desire for risk reduction and regulation. Our work builds on and extends earlier studies with a smaller number of hazards and risk characteristics (Fischhoff et al., 1978).},

The resulting “probability neglect” helps to explain excessive reactions to low-probability risks of catastrophe. Terrorists show a working knowledge of probability neglect, producing public fear that might greatly exceed the discounted harm. As a result of probability neglect, people often are far more concerned about the risks of terrorism than about statistically larger risks that they confront in ordinary life. In the context of terrorism and analogous risks, the legal system frequently responds to probability neglect, resulting in regulation that might be unjustified or even counterproductive. But public fear is itself a cost, and it is associated with many other costs, in the form of “ripple effects” produced by fear. As a normative matter, government should reduce even unjustified fear, if the benefits of the response can be shown to outweigh the costs.},

We present the results of a comprehensive meta-analysis investigating fear appeals’ effectiveness for influencing attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. We tested predictions from a large number of theories, the majority of which have never been tested meta-analytically until now. Studies were included if they contained a treatment group exposed to a fear appeal, a valid comparison group, a manipulation of depicted fear, a measure of attitudes, intentions, or behaviors concerning the targeted risk or recommended solution, and adequate statistics to calculate effect sizes. The meta-analysis included 127 articles (9\% unpublished) yielding 248 independent samples (NTotal = 27,372) collected from diverse populations. Results showed a positive effect of fear appeals on attitudes, intentions, and behaviors, with the average effect on a composite index being random-effects d = 0.29. Moderation analyses based on prominent fear appeal theories showed that the effectiveness of fear appeals increased when the message included efficacy statements, depicted high susceptibility and severity, recommended one-time only (vs. repeated) behaviors, and targeted audiences that included a larger percentage of female message recipients. Overall, we conclude that (a) fear appeals are effective at positively influencing attitude, intentions, and behaviors; (b) there are very few circumstances under which they are not effective; and (c) there are no identified circumstances under which they backfire and lead to undesirable outcomes.

This article draws on theories of risk and emergency communication in order to consider the impact of Twitter as a tool for communicating risks to the public. We analyse 10,020 Twitter messages posted by the official accounts of UK local government authorities (councils) in the context of two major emergencies: the heavy snow of December 2010 and the riots of August 2011. Twitter was used in a variety of ways to communicate and manage associated risks including messages to provide official updates, encourage protective behaviour, increase awareness and guide public attention to mitigating actions. We discuss the importance of social media as means of increasing confidence in emergency management institutions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test the effectiveness of messages designed to reduce vaccine misperceptions and increase vaccination rates for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR).
METHODS: A Web-based nationally representative 2-wave survey experiment was conducted with 1759 parents age 18 years and older residing in the United States who have children in their household age 17 years or younger (conducted June–July 2011). Parents were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 interventions: (1) information explaining the lack of evidence that MMR causes autism from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (2) textual information about the dangers of the diseases prevented by MMR from the Vaccine Information Statement; (3) images of children who have diseases prevented by the MMR vaccine; (4) a dramatic narrative about an infant who almost died of measles from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheet; or to a control group.
RESULTS: None of the interventions increased parental intent to vaccinate a future child. Refuting claims of an MMR/autism link successfully reduced misperceptions that vaccines cause autism but nonetheless decreased intent to vaccinate among parents who had the least favorable vaccine attitudes. In addition, images of sick children increased expressed belief in a vaccine/autism link and a dramatic narrative about an infant in danger increased self-reported belief in serious vaccine side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Current public health communications about vaccines may not be effective. For some parents, they may actually increase misperceptions or reduce vaccination intention. Attempts to increase concerns about communicable diseases or correct false claims about vaccines may be especially likely to be counterproductive. More study of pro-vaccine messaging is needed.},

	abstract = {Decisions concerning the appropriate listing status of species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) can be controversial even among conservationists. These decisions may determine whether a species persists in the near term and have long-lasting social and political ramifications. Given the ESA's mandate that such decisions be based on the best available science, it is important to examine what factors contribute to experts' judgments concerning the listing of species. We examined how a variety of factors (such as risk perception, value orientations, and norms) influenced experts' judgments concerning the appropriate listing status of the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Experts were invited to complete an online survey examining their perceptions of the threats grizzly bears face and their listing recommendation. Although experts' assessments of the threats to this species were strongly correlated with their recommendations for listing status, this relationship did not exist when other cognitive factors were included in the model. Specifically, values related to human use of wildlife and norms (i.e., a respondent's expectation of peers' assessments) were most influential in listing status recommendations. These results suggest that experts' decisions about listing, like all human decisions, are subject to the use of heuristics (i.e., decision shortcuts). An understanding of how heuristics and related biases affect decisions under uncertainty can help inform decision making about threatened and endangered species and may be useful in designing effective processes for protection of imperiled species.},

Taking the approach of strategic health risk communication, this study examined Ebola-related social media posts by three major health organizations, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, also known as Doctors without Borders), on Twitter and Instagram, focusing on the types of communication that were used during the outbreak, the content and context of these communications, and the responses they elicited from the publics. While both platforms were utilized by all three health organizations, the results suggest that Instagram may be a particularly useful platform for establishing meaningful, interactive communication with the publics in times of global health crises, as evidenced by significantly greater levels of engagement on the part of health organizations and the publics. Furthermore, our findings indicate that social media messaging may be most effective when it is used by health organizations that are familiar with and to the publics, and when it is based on the strategic use of risk communication principles such as solution-based messaging, incorporation of visual imagery, and acknowledgement of public fears and concerns. We discuss the results in the context of strategic health risk communication guidelines and implications for public relations practice.},

	abstract = {Aim
This study examines risk perceptions toward nuclear power before and after the Fukushima Daiichi disaster using nationally representative survey samples of American adults.
Scope
On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 8.4 earthquake, the largest in the nation's history, occurred off the coast of Japan. The earthquake produced a devastating tsunami that flooded areas of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and resulted in a loss of power to the plant's cooling system. In the weeks that followed, the world watched as Japanese and international nuclear power safety experts scrambled to contain the damage and prevent a full meltdown. Although the Fukushima Daiichi disaster was heavily covered in media, there is little empirical research on how this coverage impacted audience risk perceptions. Our analysis goes beyond examining aggregate risk perceptions, instead focusing on how specific sub-populations responded to the disaster.
Conclusion
We found that ideological groups responded differently to the events in Japan. In particular, risk perceptions among conservatives decreased following the incident. Moreover, we found that media use exacerbated these effects. We discuss possible explanations for these findings.},

To gain insight into achieving such purposes, rhetoricians can learn from theories in the social science subdisciplines of risk perception and communication. Theorists in these fields identify various psychological, social, political, and cultural dynamics that risk communicators must address in order to generate new processes of debate. I apply many of these theoretical principles to a sample risk communication on nuclear energy to determine realistic expectations for persuasive risk communications. My conclusions stress that rhetorical researchers need to explore and test the extent to which written rhetorical forms can facilitate consensus.},

	abstract = {This article traces the emergence of security at the Olympic Games as a key concern of host governments and of the Olympic movement and analyses the implications of this heightened concern for the delivery of the Games, the local host community and for national security policy. It is argued that the Olympic Games, as a high profile media event, provide an increasingly attractive political opportunity structure for a range of political actors—an attraction that is intensified when the Games are held in a world city such as London. Since the 9/11 attacks in New York there has been a sharp increase in security expenditure for the Olympic Games, arguably significantly out of proportion to the likely risk. The cost of security has risen from approximately \$108 million in 1996 (Atlanta) to an estimated \$1.99 billion in 2012 (London). It is argued that the period since 2001 has been characterized by hyper-insecurity and a culture of intense risk aversion based not on probability but on the possibility of attack. Among the consequences of this development is a desensitization of host nations to the increased securitization of their cities. It is also argued that the impact on the local UK host community of Newham will be significant not only as a result of the intense level of policing, but also owing to the redevelopment associated with the Games and the use of the surveillance infrastructure to create a virtual gated community in the post-Games athletes' village. The article concludes by discussing some of the longer-term implications of the increased securitization of the Olympic Games, including the normalization of intense surveillance, the further encroachment on civil liberties and the growing tension between the values espoused by the Olympic movement and the reality of a successful delivery of the Games.},

This cross-cultural exploration found only weak relationships among these variables, calling into question the common assumption that higher science literacy produces greater acceptance (whether or not mediated by lower perceived risk). The relationship between encouragement and trust in specific social institutions was also weak. However, regression analysis based on "trust gap" variables (defined as numerical differences between trust in specific pairs of actors) did predict national levels of encouragement for several applications, suggesting an opinion formation climate in which audiences are actively choosing among competing claims.

Prior research has identified the presence of an optimistic bias that affects risk perception, but there is a dearth of literature examining how these perceptions differ among cultures—particularly with regard to mass disasters. The present study explores differences among Japanese, Argentinean, and North American mental health workers in their rates of the optimistic bias in risk perceptions as contrasted between natural disasters and terrorist events. The results indicate a significant difference among cultures in levels of perceived risk that do not correspond to actual exposure rates. Japanese groups had the highest risk perceptions for both types of hazards and North Americans and Argentineans had the lowest risk perceptions for terrorism. Additionally, participants across all cultures rated risk to self as lower than risk to others (optimistic bias) across all disaster types. These findings suggest that cultural factors may have a greater influence on risk perception than social exposure, and that the belief that one is more immune to disasters compared to others may be a cross-cultural phenomenon.},

A multiple mediation analysis indicated that prototypes, attitudes, and perceptions of use mediated the relationship between the content of the Facebook profile and willingness.

	abstract = {Purpose
Adolescent drivers are at elevated crash risk due to distracted driving behavior (DDB). Understanding parental and peer influences on adolescent DDB may aid future efforts to decrease crash risk. We examined the influence of risk perception, sensation seeking, as well as descriptive and injunctive social norms on adolescent DDB using the theory of normative social behavior.
Methods
403 adolescents (aged 16–18 years) and their parents were surveyed by telephone. Survey instruments measured self-reported sociodemographics, DDB, sensation seeking, risk perception, descriptive norms (perceived parent DDB, parent self-reported DDB, and perceived peer DDB), and injunctive norms (parent approval of DDB and peer approval of DDB). Hierarchical multiple linear regression was used to predict the influence of descriptive and injunctive social norms, risk perception, and sensation seeking on adolescent DDB.
Results
92\% of adolescents reported regularly engaging in DDB. Adolescents perceived that their parents and peers participated in DDB more frequently than themselves. Adolescent risk perception, parent DDB, perceived parent DDB, and perceived peer DDB were predictive of adolescent DDB in the regression model, but parent approval and peer approval of DDB were not predictive. Risk perception and parental DDB were stronger predictors among males, whereas perceived parental DDB was stronger for female adolescents.
Conclusions
Adolescent risk perception and descriptive norms are important predictors of adolescent distracted driving. More study is needed to understand the role of injunctive normative influences on adolescent DDB. Effective public health interventions should address parental role modeling, parental monitoring of adolescent driving, and social marketing techniques that correct misconceptions of norms related to around driver distraction and crash risk.},

We explore this possibility using data from a public opinion survey of residents living in potential locations for a new biological research facility in the United States. Controlling for a variety of key information variables, our results show that two dimensions of discussion—frequency and valence—have impacts on residents’ perceptions of the facility's benefits and its risks. We also explore the possibility that an individual's overall attitude moderates the effect of discussion on their perceptions of risks and benefits. Our results demonstrate the potential for discussions to operate as amplifiers or attenuators of perceptions of both risks and benefits.},

Contemporaneously, technological advances have enabled members of the public to create and disseminate independent media products. The growth in ‘citizen journalism’ has been facilitated by technological convergence and the development of an interactive media environment in which citizens are not simply sources of information and/or audiences, but also recorders and creators of news. Despite fundamental changes in news production, the impact of citizen journalism on the reporting of risk remains an undeveloped area. This article maps out the range of effects that citizen journalism has on the production and presentation of risk information. From a constructive angle, we consider the extent to which citizen journalism adds to the plurality of risk discourses, democratises news flows and sets alternate news values. This positive account is counterbalanced by an analysis of the limits of citizen journalism, including the problem of distortion, issues of unequal access and the embedding of populist forms of news presentation. In the light of this analysis, the article concludes by illuminating salient research gaps and identifying areas ripe for empirical investigation.},

Information in newspapers can amplify or attenuate readers’ perceptions of health risk depending on how it is presented. Five geographically distinct wind energy installations in Ontario, Canada were identified, and newspapers published in their surrounding communities were systematically searched for articles on health effects from industrial wind turbines from May 2007 to April 2011. The authors retrieved 421 articles from 13 community, 2 provincial, and 2 national newspapers. To measure the emotional tone of the articles, the authors used a list of negative and positive words, informed from previous studies as well as from a random sample of newspaper articles included in this study. The majority of newspaper articles (64.6\%, n = 272) emphasized negative rather than positive/neutral tone, with community newspapers publishing a higher proportion of negative articles than provincial or national newspapers, χ2(2) = 15.1, p {\textless} .001. Articles were more likely to be negative when published 2 years after compared with 2 years before provincial legislation to reduce dependence on fossil fuels (the Green Energy Act), χ2(3) = 9.7, p {\textless} .05. Repeated public exposure to negative newspaper content may heighten readers’ health risk perceptions about wind energy.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Surveys have shown that many people now turn to the Internet for health information when making health-related decisions. This study systematically analyzed the HPV vaccine information returned by online search engines. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease and is the leading cause of cervical cancers.
METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of 89 top search results from Google, Yahoo, Bing, and Ask.com. The websites were analyzed with respect to source, tone, information related to specific content analyzed through the lens of the Health Belief Model, and in terms of two content themes (i.e., conspiracy theories and civil liberties). The relations among these aspects of the websites were also explored.
RESULTS: Most websites were published by nonprofit or academic sources (34.8\%) and governmental agencies (27.4\%) and were neutral in tone (57.3\%), neither promoting nor opposing the HPV vaccine. Overall, the websites presented suboptimal or inaccurate information related to the five behavioral predictors stipulated in the Health Belief Model. Questions related to civil liberties were present on some websites.
CONCLUSION: Health professionals designing online communication with the intent of increasing HPV vaccine uptake should take care to include information about the risks of HPV, including susceptibility and severity. Additionally, websites should include information about the benefits of the vaccine (i.e., effective against HPV), low side effects as a barrier that can be overcome, and ways in which to receive the vaccine to raise individual self-efficacy.},

This study investigates whether risk communication scholar Dr. Peter Sandman's outrage factors intensify journalistic attention to health risks from food consumption. A content analysis of a health institution's press releases was conducted to examine 15 outrage factors of food risks conveyed in the governmental risk communication. In addition, the news stories covering the food risks informed by the press releases were calculated to evaluate the relation between outrage factors of a risk and the number of news stories covering the risk. Results showed that controllability was the most salient outrage factor, followed by trust, voluntariness, familiarity, and human origin; the greater the outrage score of a risk, the more news stories of the risk. For individual outrage factors, a risk with an implication of catastrophic potential was associated with an increase of news stories. Food providers’ distrustful behaviors also influenced journalistic attention to the food risks. The implication of the findings to health message designers is discussed.},

Coverage in The New York Times, for example, included an abundance of background and explanatory information about the Fukushima accident and radiation releases in multiple formats and gave readers the opportunity to better understand technical information.

The goal of this study is threefold: to investigate who is using online sources for information and news about science and nanotechnology, to examine what the general public is searching for online with regards to nanotechnology, and to analyze what they find in online content of nanotechnology. Using survey data, we find those who report the Internet as their primary source of science and technology news are diverse in age, more knowledgeable about science and nanotechnology, highly educated, male, and more diverse racially than users of other media. In a comparison of demographic data on actual visits by online users to general news and science Web sites, science sites attracted more male, non-white users from the Western region of the United States than news sites did. News sites, on the other hand, attracted those with a slightly higher level of education. Our analysis of published estimates of keyword searches on nanotechnology reveals people are turning to the Internet to search for keyword searches related to the future, health, and applications of nanotechnology. A content analysis of online content reveals health content dominates overall. Comparisons of content in different types of sites—blogs, government, and general sites—are conducted.},

	abstract = {In 2005, Swiss citizens endorsed a moratorium on gene technology, resulting in the prohibition of the commercial cultivation of genetically modified crops and the growth of genetically modified animals until 2013. However, scientific research was not affected by this moratorium, and in 2008, GMO field experiments were conducted that allowed us to examine the factors that influence their acceptance by the public. In this study, trust and confidence items were analyzed using principal component analysis. The analysis revealed the following three factors: “economy/health and environment” (value similarity based trust), “trust and honesty of industry and scientists” (value similarity based trust), and “competence” (confidence). The results of a regression analysis showed that all the three factors significantly influenced the acceptance of GM field experiments. Furthermore, risk communication scholars have suggested that fairness also plays an important role in the acceptance of environmental hazards. We, therefore, included measures for outcome fairness and procedural fairness in our model. However, the impact of fairness may be moderated by moral conviction. That is, fairness may be significant for people for whom GMO is not an important issue, but not for people for whom GMO is an important issue. The regression analysis showed that, in addition to the trust and confidence factors, moral conviction, outcome fairness, and procedural fairness were significant predictors. The results suggest that the influence of procedural fairness is even stronger for persons having high moral convictions compared with persons having low moral convictions.},

Although scholars have speculated that exposure to this information leads to increased public confusion, less trust in health recommendations, and less engagement in health behaviors, there is a lack of empirical research that directly addresses the role of media exposure to conflicting information. Using data from the Annenberg National Health Communication Survey, this study finds that exposure to conflicting information on the health benefits and risks of, for example, wine, fish, and coffee consumption is associated with confusion about what foods are best to eat and the belief that nutrition scientists keep changing their minds. There is evidence that these beliefs, in turn, may lead people to doubt nutrition and health recommendations more generally-including those that are not rife with contradictory information (e.g., fruit/vegetable consumption, exercise). The implications of these findings for healthy eating campaigns and interventions are discussed.},

	abstract = {Public participation requires the involvement of lay people in the decision-making processes of issues that concern them. It is currently practiced in a variety of domains, such as transport and environmental planning. Communicating risks can be a complex task, as there may be significant differences between the risk perceptions of experts and those of lay people. Among the plethora of problems that require public involvement is the site selection of a nuclear waste disposal site in the United Kingdom, which is discussed in this article. Previous ineffective attempts to locate a site provide evidence that the problem has a strong social dimension, and studies ascribe public opposition to a loss of public trust in governmental agencies and decisionmakers, and to a lack of public understanding of nuclear waste issues. Although the mental models approach has been successfully used in the effective communication of such risks as climate change, no attempt has been made to follow a prescriptive mental model approach to develop risk communication messages that inform lay people about nuclear waste disposal. After interviewing 20 lay people and 5 experts, we construct and compare their corresponding mental models to reveal any gaps and misconceptions. The mental models approach is further applied here to identify lay people's requirements regarding what they want to know about nuclear waste, and how this information should be presented so that it is easily understood. This article further describes how the mental models approach was used in the subsequent development of an online information system for the site selection of a nuclear waste repository in the United Kingdom, which is considered essential for the improvement of public understanding and the reestablishment of trust.},

prospects of the same valence. For instance, a medical drug with a potential side
effect of seizures is viewed as less threatening when it also has smaller potential
side effects, such as congestion and fatigue; travel insurance covering serious in-
jury is viewed as less attractive when it also covers minor ailments; a lottery offer-
ing a chance to win an iPad is viewed as less attractive when it also offers a
chance to win smaller prizes. As a result, consumers can perceive normatively
more dangerous (beneficial) options to be less dangerous (beneficial) and norma-
tively less dangerous (beneficial) options to be more dangerous (beneficial). This
effect arises because people believe that larger prospects (e.g., seizures) are less
likely than smaller prospects (e.g., congestion). Therefore, inclusion of smaller
prospects by contrast makes a larger prospect appear less likely, which in turn re-
duces the perceived value of the risky option. Thus, this effect arises only when
smaller prospects are added to a larger prospect, and only when the prospects
are probabilistic. Cognitive load and feelings of personal control also moderate the
effect.},

Widespread use of uranium was found in colored glass, enamels and ceramics produced between the 1830s and 1940s. Simple tests can be used to determine the presence of uranium in objects. This knowledge can be useful for authentication purposes; the presence of uranium may also compromise thermoluminescence dating of ancient objects stored nearby. Little health risk from uranium-containing objects was found unless many objects were stored in a small area, or if acidic or alkaline foods were stored in them and consumed in quantity. /// L'examen de plus de 400 objets de verre, d'émail et de céramique provenant de musées ou de collections privées a été effectué afin d'estimer l'importance des colorants à l'uranium.

Des tests simples permettent de déterminer la présence d'uranium dans les objets. La présence d'uranium peut être utile pour authentifier un objet mais pourrait altérer les résultats de datation par thermoluminescence d'objets anciens entreposés à proximité.

Dies kann vor allem für Echtheitsprüfung von Bedeutung sein, könnte jedoch die Ergebnisse von Thermoluminiszenzdatierungen verfälschen. Es konnte gezeigt werden, daß von den Objekten nur ein geringes Gesundheitsrisiko ausgeht, auch wenn viele Objekte in kleinen Räumen gelagert, oder wenn saure oder basische Speisen in ihnen gelagert und in großen Mengen verzehrt werden. /// Una serie de unos 400 objetos cerámicos, de vidrio y esmaltes procedentes de museos y colecciones particulares se analizaron con el fin de investigar la presencia de colorantes derivados del uranio.

Pruebas simples pueden ser utilizadas para determinar la presencia de uranio en objetos. Esto puede ser útil con fines de autenticación pero podria alterar las pruebas de datación por termoluminiscencia en antigüedades. El riesgo para la salud es mínimo con los objetos que contienen uranio, excepto en el caso de que muchos objetos sean guardados en un área muy pequeña o si se almacenan en ellos alimentos de carácter alcalino y son éstos consumidos en cantidades considerables.},

	abstract = {Samples of orange, yellow, beige, ivory and blue-green ceramic dinnerware glazed with uranium compounds have been examined. Measurements at glaze surfaces yielded exposure rates of 3.8–16 mR/h (1–4 μC/kgh) for orange glazes and rates of 0.04–1.3 mR/h (0.01–0.3 μC/kgh) for ivory beige, and yellow glazes. Whole body exposure from a shelf display of 40 orange dishes was estimated to be 0.1–0.5 mR/h (0.03–0.13 μC/kgh), or up to 50 times the room background radiation level, at a distance of 1 meter. Twenty-four hour leaching tests of orange, yellow, and ivory dishes were carried out with various concentrations of acetic and citric acids. Uranium concentrations in leachates of some orange dishes exceeded 450 mg/l. Uranium is a chemical nephrotoxin and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a maximum contaminant level for drinking water of 0.020 mg/l. Based on this value a person consuming, 2.2 l of drinking water per day would ingest 0.31 mg of uranium per week. A person eating once a week from an orange glazed dish could easily ingest 10 or more times this amount.},

We have further been able to produce soluble uranium compounds on the surfaces of clean dishes by exposing them to household vinegar or bleach. We estimate that handling of a contaminated dish can transfer up to 1–2 becquerels or more of uranium compounds to the hands. Uranium contamination is of concern because the element is not only an alpha emitter but also a chemical nephrotoxin. Although the amount of uranium likely to be ingested as a result of casual handling may be small, it could still exceed by several times the amount occurring in the average diet (about 40 mBq/day). Furthermore, since fresh surface compounds are readily formed, it is possible that a person who regularly handles or eats from uranium-glazed dinnerware can accidentally ingest significant amounts of uranium.},

Reactivity and scalability are especially important requirements for such visualization of distributed processes. We have proposed the visualization technique "Data Jewelry Box" algorithm, which satisfies both of the above requirements. The technique can be applied for the visualization of distributed processes, however, the algorithm has a problem that may yield much different data layouts even among very similar datasets. This is a serious issue for the seamless visualization of time-varying data. To solve the problem, we propose the extension of "Data Jewelry Box" algorithm. The extension places data elements referring positions of the previous data layout, so that the extension can yield similar layouts among similar datasets. We introduce the extended algorithm, and propose the visualization system for distributed computing systems using the extended algorithm.},

We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

	abstract = {Editor's note, 17 March, 12:45 p.m.: In setting the context in this opinion piece, an individual (Science Sam) was identified and many have read the article as a personal attack. This was not the intent of the author or the editors, and we apologize. We are examining our editorial process for these pieces moving forward. 

Science Sam is a big name on campus. She's a Ph.D. candidate in the sciences who wants to pursue a career outside of academia, like me. But unlike me, she is our school's science communication, or \#scicomm, superstar. Her Instagram page, which aims to show the “fun and trendy” side of science, was recently celebrated in the school's newsletter for increasing the public's trust in scientists. At a career workshop, graduate students were urged to follow Science Sam's example and use \#scicomm to build our personal brands as we enter the job market. I already have an Instagram account, but it reflects my interests in photography and baking more than my love of science. The workshop got me thinking: Should my posts focus less on pastries and more on pipettes?

![Figure][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater}

ILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER

{\textgreater} “Publicly documenting … the sweet smile I brandish in the lab isn't going to help me.” 

I followed Sam on Instagram, and I soon found many other female graduate students and postdocs whose Instagram pages are filled with pretty selfies, fun videos, and microscope images captioned with accessible language and cute emojis. These researchers assert themselves as scientists who don't fit the stereotypes that are typically applied to women in the field. They are not boring or unfashionable. Instead, their posts demonstrate that they're interested in clothes and makeup, that they're physically active, and that they are attractive romantic partners. By visibly contradicting stereotypes about female scientists, it is clear that they hope to inspire girls to pursue science and to encourage female scientists to showcase their femininity in our male-dominated work spaces.

If I had seen these posts when I was 17, maybe I would have been more confident that I would excel in engineering even though I spent my time in the darkroom developing photos, not in the computer lab learning to code like the male engineers I saw in popular culture. But instead of cheering on Instagram's dynamic and vibrant \#scicomm women, I felt an increasing bitterness with each post I came across, though I struggled to understand why.

After long conversations with other women in my lab, I realized that I am not bitter toward the authors of these posts. Although I am annoyed that the majority of the posts seem to celebrate a very narrow representation of femininity, my real bitterness comes from the systemic challenges that these posts are working to address, and from seeing so many young female scientists compelled to turn to their personal social media pages to try to correct the system's failures.

I have come to understand \#scicomm on Instagram as a digital demonstration of the efforts that many female scientists exert daily to correct for gender disparities. Female scientists spend demonstrably more time teaching, mentoring, and participating in community outreach than their male colleagues, just as there are far more female \#scicommers on Instagram than male. I liken the many hours that Science Sam spends on her Instagram content to the volunteer work a female professor in my department put into organizing a summer program to introduce teens from underrepresented communities to biomedical engineering.

A lot of good comes from the work of female scientists on Instagram. But it disturbs me that these efforts are celebrated as ways to correct for the long held and deeply structured forms of discrimination and exclusion that female scientists face. I wonder whether our efforts should instead be directed toward advocating for policy changes at institutional and governmental levels.

When I next interview for a job, I won't have an Instagram page to show that my love of science doesn't make me boring and unfriendly. Publicly documenting the cute outfit I wear and the sweet smile I brandish in the lab isn't going to help me build a fulfilling career in a field where women hold less senior positions, are paid less, and are continuously underrated. Time spent on Instagram is time away from research, and this affects women in science more than men. That's unfair. Let's not celebrate that.

	abstract = {Effective science communication is essential to share knowledge and recruit the next generation of researchers. Science communication to the general public can, however, be hampered by limited resources and a lack of incentives in the academic environment. Various social media platforms have recently emerged, providing free and simple science communication tools to reach the public and young people especially, an audience often missed by more conventional outreach initiatives. While individual researchers and large institutions are present on social media, smaller research groups are underrepresented. As a small group of oceanographers, sea ice scientists, and atmospheric scientists at the Norwegian Polar Institute, we share our experience establishing, developing, and maintaining a successful Arctic science communication initiative (@oceanseaicenpi) on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. The initiative is run entirely by a team of researchers with limited time and financial resources. It has built a broad audience of more than 7,000 followers, half of which is associated with the team’s Instagram account. To our knowledge, @oceanseaicenpi is one of the most successful Earth sciences Instagram accounts managed by researchers. The initiative has boosted the alternative metric scores of our publications and helped participating researchers become better writers and communicators. We hope to inspire and help other research groups by providing some guidelines on how to develop and conduct effective science communication via social media.},

	abstract = {There are many ways to communicate science, but few as expedient and direct as social media. But while Twitter and Instagram have given scientists unprecedented, unfiltered reach to new audiences, there has been a desire to understand how scientists who use those platforms are perceived by those audiences. A recent paper published in PLOS ONE details results from the Scientists of Instagram project which highlights how real-life scientists share their work and lives via Instagram and how they are perceived by survey respondents. The paper, led by Dr. Paige Jarreau, shows that survey respondents (1,620 in total) found scientists posting selfies (or self-portraits, if you didn't know) were perceived as warmer and more trustworthy, yet no less competent, than scientists posting photos of only their work. The indication here is clear. People respond to the human element. The story behind the science. Stereotypes and Reality A pervasive impression of scientists is that we are nerdy, aloof, and generally socially inept. This stereotype is so ingrained it even forms the central focus of TV shows like the Big Bang Theory where male scientists are obsessive, fumbling geeks, while female scientists are either incredibly nerdy, or hypersexualized. This tired trope has become a lens through which the general public has come to view scientists. Counter to this, scientists may also be perceived as competent, but cold. You can pick your own movie scientist for this one, there are . . . a few. However, platforms such as Twitter and Instagram (the focus of this study) allow scientists to individuate* themselves and connect to their audience. While a picture of some beakers on a lab bench perpetuates the detached narrative of science we have come to embrace, a person working at that bench carries with it that human connection. People begin to see the folks who do scientist, folks who look just like all the other folks. They just sometimes wear lab coats, or fish turtles from ponds, or stare at computer screens and pound on their desk because their code isn't working. You know, you and me 😊. Further, this work also highlights the impact of broad representation in science. Tespondents who viewed images of female scientists perceived science as less exclusively male. Female scientist selfies resulted in more positive evaluations of competence and instead of perceptions that scientists are vain or self-absorbed. Science is not exclusively stale, pale males and social media lets scientists show who they are and create their own narratives. "Social media platforms could represent a turning of the tide for perceptions of scientists if leveraged by diverse individuals to interact with broad audiences in ways that communicate warmth and build mutual trust." - Jarreau et al. 2019 Instagram and Beyond There are many lessons here for science communication broadly as these ideas are translatable directly to classrooms and presentations. Seeing people DO science builds our investment in science. Science is more than a body of work, it is the people who do that work. This paper clearly highlights that fact—people relate to people. That is what moves them. I think scientists ought to take this information and run with it. Go beyond social media and incorporate more pictures and images of folks doing science into lessons, presentations, and depictions of science. I don't need to see your gas chromatograph, I want to see you working with it and telling me what's going on. What can you do? As Jarreau and her authors point out, there are many things scientists can do to improve how they communicate via social media. 1) Create personal content – Include detailed captions to the selfies and images that are posted. What is that thing you are standing in front of? What does it do? How are you using it? What are the implications? 2) Share real life – The authors particularly highlight the importance of representation of minority groups and how simply the presence of folks from minority groups alters the perceptions of science and scientists. Children who don't fit the traditional mold of what they are told a scientist "is" can change that perception when they see folks who look like them. Representation matters. Period. 3) Engage – Answer questions from folks who post responses to what you post. Build that conversation and relate. Maybe in the end social media is not the thing for you, and that's okay. But there is growing evidence beyond this paper that shows that social media is a powerful piece of a scientist's toolkit to communicate, collaborate, and positively impact the perceptions of their work and that of their field. *This is such a good word and total props to Jarreau et al. for using it and bringing it to my attention in their paper.},

	abstract = {Photos are becoming prominent means of communication online. Despite photos’ pervasive presence in social media and online world, we know little about how people interact and engage with their content. Understanding how photo content might signify engagement, can impact both science and design, inﬂuencing production and distribution. One common type of photo content that is shared on social media, is the photos of people. From studies of ofﬂine behavior, we know that human faces are powerful channels of non-verbal communication. In this paper, we study this behavioral phenomena online. We ask how presence of a face, it’s age and gender might impact social engagement on the photo. We use a corpus of 1 million Instagram images and organize our study around two social engagement feedback factors, likes and comments. Our results show that photos with faces are 38\% more likely to receive likes and 32\% more likely to receive comments, even after controlling for social network reach and activity. We ﬁnd, however, that the number of faces, their age and gender do not have an effect. This work presents the ﬁrst results on how photos with human faces relate to engagement on large scale image sharing communities. In addition to contributing to the research around online user behavior, our ﬁndings offer a new line of future work using visual analysis.},

	abstract = {The ability to clearly disseminate scientific knowledge is a skill that is necessary for any undergraduate student within the sciences. Traditionally, this is accomplished through the instruction of scientific presentation or writing with a focus on peer-to-peer communication at the expense of teaching communication aimed at a nonscientific audience. One of the ramifications of focusing on peer-to-peer communication has presented itself as an apprehension toward scientific knowledge within the general populace. This apprehension can be seen in a variety of venues, including the traditional media, popular culture, and education, which generally paint scientists as aloof and with an inability to discuss scientific issues to anyone other than other scientists. This paper describes a curriculum designed to teach Introduction to Anatomy and Physiology students the tools necessary for communicating complex concepts that were covered during the semester using approachable language. Students were assessed on their word usage in associated writing activities, the student’s ability to reduce complexity of their statements, and performance in an informal scientific presentation to a lay audience. Results showed that this pedagogical approach has increased students’ ability to reduce the complexity of their language in both a written and oral format. This, in turn, led to evaluators reporting greater levels of understanding of the topic presented following the presentation.},

These synthesized research perspectives are relatively novel but serve an important need to better understand the impacts that the advent of rapidly emerging technologies will have on a new generation of scientists and engineers including their formal communication with engaged citizenry. This cross-national study examined postsecondary science and engineering students’ (n = 254 from five countries: Austria, Finland, France, Israel, and USA) perspectives on the role of science communication in their own formal science and engineering education. More broadly, we examined participants’ understanding of their perceived responsibilities of communicating science and engineering to the general public when an issue contains complex social and ethical implications (SEI). The study is contextualized in the emergent technology of nanotechnology for which SEI are of particular concern and for which the general public often perceives conflicting risks and benefits. Findings indicate that student participants’ hold similar views on the need for their own training in communication as future scientists and engineers. When asked about the role that ethics and risk perception plays in research, development, and public communication of nanotechnology, participants demonstrate similar trajectories of perspectives that are, however, often anchored in very different levels of beginning concern. Results are discussed in the context of considerations for science communication training within formal science education curricula globally.},

The article focuses on double standards for competence in task groups and begins by examining how status characteristics (e.g. gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic class) become a basis for stricter standards for the lower status person. I also discuss other bases for this practice (e.g. personality characteristics, allocated rewards, sentiments of either like or dislike). Next, I describe double standards in the inference of other types of valued attributes (e.g. beauty, morality, mental health) and examine the relationship between these practices and competence double standards. The article concludes with a discussion of “reverse” double standards for competence, namely, the practice of applying more lenient ability standards to lower status individuals.},

	abstract = {In contemporary research, attitudes toward women appear to be more positive than those toward men in samples of US and Canadian university students, and the evaluative content of the female stereotype is more favorable than the evaluative content of the male stereotype. These research findings on attitudes and stereotypes are compared with the findings of Goldberg-paradigm experiments on judgments of women's and men's competence, which are commonly thought to reflect people's attitudes and stereotypes. Although research on competence judgments has not shown a pervasive tendency to devalue women's work, it has demonstrated prejudice against women in masculine domains (e.g. male-dominated jobs, male-stereotypic behavior). This targeted form of prejudice is consistent with the generally more favorable evaluation of women than men obtained in attitude and stereotype studies because this positive evaluation derives primarily from the ascription to women of nice, nurturant, communal characteristics, which people think qualify individuals for the domestic role as well as for low-status, low-paying female-dominated jobs. Women's experiences of gender discrimination and feminist protests concerning a contemporary backlash against women reflect women's inroads into traditionally masculine arenas, especially their efforts to gain access to high-status, high-paying male-dominated jobs, which are thought to require characteristics stereotypically ascribed to men.},

The hiree was either a man or a woman, and the woman either was or was not associated with an affirmative action program. The affirmative action label was found to negatively affect the perceived competence of women hirees regardless of the degree to which the job was male sex-typed. A field investigation in which 184 White men provided information about their co-workers supported these results. It additionally demonstrated that the relationship between perceived competence and presumed affirmative action status held not only when co-workers were White women but when they were Black men and Black women as well. The affirmative action label also was associated with negative characterizations of activity and potency and, in the field study, interpersonal attributes and prognoses for career progress.

The researchers tended to share more links and retweet more than the average Twitter users in earlier research and there were clear disciplinary differences in how they used Twitter. Biochemists retweeted substantially more than researchers in the other disciplines. Researchers in digital humanities and cognitive science used Twitter more for conversations, while researchers in economics shared the most links.

	abstract = {Metrics derived from Twitter and other social media—often referred to as altmetrics—are increasingly used to estimate the broader social impacts of scholarship. Such efforts, however, may produce highly misleading results, as the entities that participate in conversations about science on these platforms are largely unknown. For instance, if altmetric activities are generated mainly by scientists, does it really capture broader social impacts of science? Here we present a systematic approach to identifying and analyzing scientists on Twitter. Our method can identify scientists across many disciplines, without relying on external bibliographic data, and be easily adapted to identify other stakeholder groups in science. We investigate the demographics, sharing behaviors, and interconnectivity of the identified scientists. We find that Twitter has been employed by scholars across the disciplinary spectrum, with an over-representation of social and computer and information scientists; under-representation of mathematical, physical, and life scientists; and a better representation of women compared to scholarly publishing. Analysis of the sharing of URLs reveals a distinct imprint of scholarly sites, yet only a small fraction of shared URLs are science-related. We find an assortative mixing with respect to disciplines in the networks between scientists, suggesting the maintenance of disciplinary walls in social media. Our work contributes to the literature both methodologically and conceptually—we provide new methods for disambiguating and identifying particular actors on social media and describing the behaviors of scientists, thus providing foundational information for the construction and use of indicators on the basis of social media metrics.},

	abstract = {Given both the historical legacy and the contemporary awareness about gender 
inequity in journalism and politics as well as the increasing importance of Twitter in 
political communication, this article considers whether the platform makes some of 
the existing gender bias against women in political journalism even worse. Using a 
framework that characterizes journalists’ Twitter behavior in terms of the dimensions 
of their peer-to-peer relationships and a comprehensive sample of permanently 
credentialed journalists for the U.S. Congress, substantial evidence of gender bias 
beyond existing inequities emerges. Most alarming is that male journalists amplify 
and engage male peers almost exclusively, while female journalists tend to engage 
most with each other. The significant support for claims of gender asymmetry as 
well as evidence of gender silos are findings that not only underscore the importance 
of further research but also suggest overarching consequences for the structure of 
contemporary political communication.},

	abstract = {Empirical studies and some high-profile anecdotal cases have demonstrated a link between suicidal ideation and experiences with bullying victimization or offending. The current study examines the extent to which a nontraditional form of peer aggression—cyberbullying—is also related to suicidal ideation among adolescents. In 2007, a random sample of 1,963 middle-schoolers from one of the largest school districts in the United States completed a survey of Internet use and experiences. Youth who experienced traditional bullying or cyberbullying, as either an offender or a victim, had more suicidal thoughts and were more likely to attempt suicide than those who had not experienced such forms of peer aggression. Also, victimization was more strongly related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors than offending. The findings provide further evidence that adolescent peer aggression must be taken seriously both at school and at home, and suggest that a suicide prevention and intervention component is essential within comprehensive bullying response programs implemented in schools.},

We are interested in understanding bullying in social networks, especially in Twitter. To best of our understanding, there is no previous work on using sentiment analysis to detect bullying instances. Our training data set consists of Twitter messages containing commonly used terms of abuse, which are considered noisy labels. These data are publicly available and can be easily retrieved by directly accessing the Twitter streaming API. For the classification of Twitter messages, also known as tweets, we use the Naïve Bayes classifier. It‟s accuracy was close to 70\% when trained with “commonly terms of abuse” data. The main contribution of this paper is the idea of using sentiment analysis to detect bullying instances.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, online aggression and abusive behaviors have occurred in many different forms and on a variety of platforms. In extreme cases, these incidents have evolved into hate, discrimination, and bullying, and even materialized into real-world threats and attacks against individuals or groups. In this paper, we study the Gamergate controversy. Started in August 2014 in the online gaming world, it quickly spread across various social networking platforms, ultimately leading to many incidents of cyberbullying and cyberaggression. We focus on Twitter, presenting a measurement study of a dataset of 340k unique users and 1.6M tweets to study the properties of these users, the content they post, and how they differ from random Twitter users. We find that users involved in this "Twitter war" tend to have more friends and followers, are generally more engaged and post tweets with negative sentiment, less joy, and more hate than random users. We also perform preliminary measurements on how the Twitter suspension mechanism deals with such abusive behaviors. While we focus on Gamergate, our methodology to collect and analyze tweets related to aggressive and bullying activities is of independent interest.},

Those who read or listen to these kinds of scientific arguments have to decide whom they can trust and which information is credible. This study investigates how the language style (neutral vs aggressive) and the professional affiliation (scientist vs lobbyist) of a person arguing in a scientific debate influence his trustworthiness and the credibility of his information. In a 2 X 2 between-subject online experiment, participants watched a scientific debate. The results show that if the person was introduced as a lobbyist, he was perceived as less trustworthy. However, the person’s professional affiliation did not affect the credibility of his information. If the person used an aggressive language style, he was perceived as less trustworthy. Furthermore, his information was perceived as less credible, and participants had the impression that they learned less from the scientific debate.},

In this eye-opening book, Brooke Erin Duffy draws much-needed attention to the gap between the handful who find lucrative careers and the rest, whose "passion projects" amount to free work for corporate brands.  Drawing on interviews and fieldwork, Duffy offers fascinating insights into the work and lives of fashion bloggers, beauty vloggers, and designers. She connects the activities of these women to larger shifts in unpaid and gendered labor, offering a lens through which to understand, anticipate, and critique broader transformations in the creative economy. At a moment when social media offer the rousing assurance that anyone can "make it"--and stand out among freelancers, temps, and gig workers--Duffy asks us all to consider the stakes of not getting paid to do what you love.},

We then present one perspective on the history of such sites, discussing key changes and developments. After briefly summarizing existing scholarship concerning SNSs, we discuss the articles in this special section and conclude with considerations for future research.},

	abstract = {Background: The Association of American Medical Colleges reports continued low rates of female faculty as professors and in leadership positions. While attrition and discrimination have both been proposed as explanations, recent literature has suggested that women’s professional motivations, ingrained behavior, and perceptions of organizational support may also play a role.
Methods: The authors employed a series of scales informed by the turnover theory (which predicts intent to leave an organization), previously validated and used in business and engineering studies, but rarely used in academic medicine. The authors proposed and tested a multiple regression model to assess predictors (role strain, work–life balance, and organizational climate) for three outcome variables: seeking promotion, seeking leadership, and intent to leave.
Results: Survey results from 614 faculty members indicated that gender signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced both promotion and leadership seeking, but not intent to leave. Perceived work–family conﬂict was negatively correlated with leadership seeking for women, but not for men. Positive views of organizational support and commitment were associated with promotion seeking and persistence for all participants. Role strain was positively correlated with desire for promotion and leadership, as well as with intent to leave.
Conclusions: Female faculty may not be leaning in to promotion and leadership roles because of increased role conﬂict, work–life concerns, and organizational factors; this seems to be more of a factor for female clinical rather than research faculty. Work–family conﬂict affects male and female faculty differently and should be addressed in efforts to retain faculty and to remove barriers for female faculty seeking leadership opportunities.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes the dynamic process of risk amplification in the Internet environment with special emphasis on public concern for environmental risks from a high-speed railway tunnel construction project in South Korea. Environmental organizations and activists serving as social stations collected information about the project and its ecological impact, and communicated this with the general public, social groups, and institutions. The Internet provides social stations and the public with an efficient means for interactive communication and an open space for active information sharing and public participation. For example, while the website of an organization such as an environmental activist group can initially trigger local interest, the Internet allows this information to be disseminated to a much wider audience in a manner unavailable to the traditional media. Interaction among social stations demonstrates an amplifying process of public attention to the risk. Analyses of the volume of readers' comments to online newspaper articles and public opinions posted on message board of public and nonprofit organizations show the ripple effects of the amplification process as measured along temporal, geographical, and sectoral dimensions. Public attention is also influenced by the symbolic connotations of risk information. Interpretations of risk in religious, political, or legal terms intensify public concern for the environmental risk.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, a great deal of news media attention has focused on informing the American public about scientific findings on global warming (GW). Has learning this sort of information led the American public to become more concerned about GW? Using data from two surveys of nationally representative samples of American adults, this article shows that the relation between self-reported knowledge and concern about GW is more complex than what previous research has suggested. Among people who trust scientists to provide reliable information about the environment and among Democrats and Independents, increased knowledge has been associated with increased concern. But among people who are skeptical about scientists and among Republicans more knowledge was generally not associated with greater concern. The association of knowledge with concern among Democrats and Independents who trust scientists was mediated by perceptions of consensus among scientists about GW's existence and by perceptions that humans are a principal cause of GW. Moreover, additional analyses of panel survey data produced findings consistent with the notion that more knowledge yields more concern among Democrats and Independents, but not among Republicans. Thus, when studying the relation of knowledge and concern, it is important to take into account the content of the information that different types of people acquire and choose to rely upon.},

	abstract = {This study examined the relationship between the content of spontaneous associations with nuclear power plants and the acceptance of using new-generation nuclear power plants to replace old ones. The study also considered gender as a variable. A representative sample of the German- and French-speaking population of Switzerland ( N= 1,221) was used. Log-linear models revealed significant two-way interactions between the association content and acceptance, association content and gender, and gender and acceptance. Correspondence analysis revealed that participants who were opposed to nuclear power plants mainly associated nuclear power plants with risk, negative feelings, accidents, radioactivity, waste disposal, military use, and negative consequences for health and environment; whereas participants favoring nuclear power plants mainly associated them with energy, appearance descriptions of nuclear power plants, and necessity. Thus, individuals opposing nuclear power plants had both more concrete and more diverse associations with them than people who were in favor of nuclear power plants. In addition, participants who were undecided often mentioned similar associations to those participants who were in favor. Males more often expressed associations with energy, waste disposal, and negative health effects. Females more often made associations with appearance descriptions, negative feelings, and negative environmental effects. The results further suggest that acceptance of replacing nuclear power plants was higher in the German-speaking part of the country, where all of the Swiss nuclear power plants are physically located. Practical implications for risk communication are discussed.},

have been signs that the nuclear power industry still dreams of a
renaissance. Nuclear power's momentum was broken in the late 1970s by
several factors, including a grassroots anti-nuclear movement that won
tightened regulations, thus raising the costs of nuclear power plant
construction and operation. Editorial cartoons in the daily press of that
time are only one of a number of fields of cartooning that document this
nuclear power controversy, and not the one that affords the closest look.
Both the nuclear industry and participants in the anti-nuclear movement
published entire comic books to explain their views of nuclear power.
Besides these special-purpose comic books, editorial cartoonists in the
weekly press and representations of nuclear power in mass entertainment
provide further bodies of visual evidence for understanding the steps by
which nuclear power won and lost the “public acceptance” that
it now tries to win back.},

While we are aware of research examining attitudes and behaviours towards green tangible products (e.g., Paladino, 2005), there is no understanding regarding how these factors apply to intangible renewable power services. Similarly, branding and its effects are scant in a contemporary green marketing context. Of this research, most has evaluated the product and not service brands. Some have researched the extent of green branding and its effects on attitudes (e.g., Hartman et al., 2005). Despite this, research evaluating the role of renewable electricity retailer brands and their characteristics is limited. This study works towards understanding this and seeks to bind the existing branding, services marketing and consumer behaviour literatures to understand the motivators behind renewable electricity purchase in Australia. With the introduction of contestable customers and the increase in importance of renewable energy around the world, it is imperative that renewable electricity retailers attract consumer interest and attain their consideration. Using focus group research and in-depth interviews from consumers in Australia, this paper analyses the strategic options available to the power provider to increase their appeal to the consumer.

	abstract = {The accidents at the Fukushima nuclear stations provided a great deal of information about the risks from nuclear power accidents. It is generally assumed that when people interpret such information, they utilize specific modes of information processing to judge the risks. Our study tests the heuristic/systematic information-processing model (HSM) on people’s perceptions of the Fukushima accidents. Because very few studies apply the HSM in a real-life context rather than in an experimental setting, our study will shed light on whether the HSM can explain this social phenomenon. To test the two modes of information processing in risk judgment, we collected social survey data (n?=?1200) through multiple-stage random quota sampling. The main topics for analysis were as follows: first, we examined how the antecedents – source, message, and receiver factors – influenced the choice of heuristic or systematic processing in the case of the Fukushima accident. Second, we analyzed the impact of the two modes of information processing on the perceived risks from the Fukushima accident. Third, we investigated the mediation of the two modes between the antecedents and the perceived risk.},

	abstract = {For twenty-five years, the Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada was designated as the sole destination for disposal of the nation's accumulated stockpiles of highly radioactive nuclear power and weapons wastes. Now the Obama administration has abandoned Yucca, and Congress must pass new laws to solve the resulting disposal crisis. Even as the federal government seeks to expand nuclear power, local communities and states are demanding a credible program for disposal of the wastes that we already have. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, appointed by the Obama administration to develop a plan, is currently conducting hearings. The first comprehensive history and overview of U.S. nuclear waste law and regulation, Fuel Cycle to Nowhere traces sixty years of nuclear weapons programs, the growth of nuclear power, and their waste legacies, the rise of environmentalism, and the responses of federal agencies. Richard and Jane Stewart expertly analyze the changing policies for storing low-level waste, transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, and high-level waste and for regulating their transport by rail and by truck. They also chronicle "a tale of two repositories"--one, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico, known as WIPP, the world's only operating deep geologic nuclear waste disposal facility, which emerged from a contentious but ultimately successful struggle between federal and state interests; the other, Yucca Mountain, mandated top down by Congress and a failure. Fuel Cycle to Nowhere provides the critical information and analysis on the waste disposal issues and solutions that the commission, Congress, the administration, journalists, policymakers, and the public so urgently need.This book is a project of the Consortium for Risk Evaluation with Stakeholder Participation (CRESP), a Vanderbilt University-led, multi-university consortium supported as a cooperative agreement by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Environmental This book is a project of the Consortium for Risk Evaluation with Stakeholder Participation (CRESP), a Vanderbilt University-led, multi-university consortium supported as a cooperative agreement by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Environmental Management to support safe, effective, publicly credible, risk informed management of existing and future nuclear waste from government and civilian sources through independent strategic analysis, review, applied research and education.},

The study also considered gender as a variable. A representative sample of the German- and French-speaking population of Switzerland ( N= 1,221) was used. Log-linear models revealed significant two-way interactions between the association content and acceptance, association content and gender, and gender and acceptance. Correspondence analysis revealed that participants who were opposed to nuclear power plants mainly associated nuclear power plants with risk, negative feelings, accidents, radioactivity, waste disposal, military use, and negative consequences for health and environment; whereas participants favoring nuclear power plants mainly associated them with energy, appearance descriptions of nuclear power plants, and necessity. Thus, individuals opposing nuclear power plants had both more concrete and more diverse associations with them than people who were in favor of nuclear power plants. In addition, participants who were undecided often mentioned similar associations to those participants who were in favor. Males more often expressed associations with energy, waste disposal, and negative health effects. Females more often made associations with appearance descriptions, negative feelings, and negative environmental effects. The results further suggest that acceptance of replacing nuclear power plants was higher in the German-speaking part of the country, where all of the Swiss nuclear power plants are physically located. Practical implications for risk communication are discussed.},

The study argues that the direct association between familiarity and support is just one way of thinking about how familiarity may affect views about emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology and nuclear energy. The study uses a probability-based survey of Americans where half received questions about nanotechnology and half received nearly identical questions about nuclear energy. Overall, it shows that the ‘standard’ predictors of technology support – risk/benefit perceptions, familiarity, and views about decision-makers – are similar for both nanotechnology and nuclear energy but that lower familiarity may also result in less ability for these variables to statistically explain support for nanotechnology. The data provide only partial evidence that citizens meaningfully differentiate between the two very different technologies, and the patterns of results lend support to the theory that generalized views about science and science decision-makers – in addition to issue-specific concerns – are central to understanding opinion dynamics involving emerging technologies like nanotechnology.},

In-depth interviews were conducted with the residents of Fukushima and other parts of Japan in November 2011 and July 2012. Compared to mothers, fathers in general expressed less concern for radiation. Fathers prioritized their responsibilities as the breadwinner for their families and saw radiation risk as a threat to economic stability and masculine identity. As a result, mothers' health concerns were dismissed, and they were prevented from taking preventive actions. The social norms in the dominant institutions such as corporations and the government influenced men's perception of radiation risk. The findings illustrate the importance of sociocultural context in which meanings of health risk are constructed.},

This research makes the case that differences in perceived vulnerability to risk explain the gender gap found in environmental surveys and other, quite distinct, areas of potential risk as well. Methods. Two national surveys, administered simultaneously and each involving very different environmental risks (hazardous waste sites and global warming), are analyzed in terms of gender differences. Results. In both surveys, in every question that involves reactions to a specific risk, women are more concerned than men. Standard deviations also are consistently smaller for women. When health-risk perceptions enter equations accounting for environmental concerns, however, the gender gap disappears. Conclusions. Questionnaire items that imply specific risks tend to produce significant gender differences. These types of survey results can be construed as communication events in which respondents who feel vulnerable answer in ways that urge caution on policymakers.},

	abstract = {Since the turn of the 21st century, there has been a revival of interest in nuclear power. Two decades ago, the expansion of nuclear power in the United States was halted by widespread public opposition as well as rising costs and less than projected increases in demand for electricity. Can the renewed enthusiasm for nuclear power overcome its history of public resistance that has persisted for decades? We propose that attitudes toward nuclear power are a function of perceived risk, and that both attitudes and risk perceptions are a function of values, beliefs, and trust in the institutions that influence nuclear policy. Applying structural equation models to data from a U.S. national survey, we find that increased trust in the nuclear governance institutions reduces perceived risk of nuclear power and together higher trust and lower risk perceptions predict positive attitudes toward nuclear power. Trust in environmental institutions and perceived risks from global environmental problems do not predict attitudes toward nuclear power. Values do predict attitudes: individuals with traditional values have greater support for, while those with altruistic values have greater opposition to, nuclear power. Nuclear attitudes do not vary by gender, age, education, income, or political orientation, though nonwhites are more supportive than whites. These findings are consistent with, and provide an explanation for, a long series of public opinion polls showing public ambivalence toward nuclear power that persists even in the face of renewed interest for nuclear power in policy circles.},

This paper aims to provide a better understanding of public opinions regarding nuclear energy by examining its risk perception, trust and public engagement dimensions. Based on a survey of Hong Kong residents (n=509), we make some observations. Firstly, we offer empirical evidence that affirms the theoretical connections between risk perception, trust, and public engagement in the context of nuclear energy. Secondly, our logistic regression analysis indicates that demographics, trust, and perceptions of the efficacy of public engagement are factors explaining perceptions of greater risks and nuclear opposition. Thirdly, our conceptual model sheds light on the complexity of the trust concept, and specifies aspects of trust that are influential in the contexts of risk perception and nuclear choices. Our findings suggest that the Hong Kong government must ensure trust building receives prominent attention in nuclear decision-making, and that it should avoid excessive reliance on the business sector and should assume a key role for itself in enhancing trust in nuclear decision-making.},

This project examines U.S. public support for nuclear energy one year after the Fukushima tragedy, seeking to understand the influence of knowledge and risk perceptions on policy support. We evaluate public support for nuclear energy policy from several perspectives using risk and attitudinal measurements that are more specific than often found in the literature to obtain a greater understanding of the connection between policy and risk.},

This study comprised a major household survey (n = 1326) and an interview study (n = 39) and was conducted close to the nuclear power stations at Oldbury and Hinkley Point, both in the UK. It investigated the roles of perceptions of place and hazard proximity in considering (a) perceptions of risk and (b) public attitudes towards the building of a new nuclear power station in the nearby area. In addition, a novel scale was developed to measure the perceived contribution of the nearby nuclear power station to sense of place. The results suggest first, that sense of place mediates (but does not moderate) perceptions of risk in very proximate communities, and second, that public attitudes to new build in communities situated very close to established nuclear sites may be largely dependent on the extent to which the existing facility is perceived to contribute towards sense of place.

This adaptation of the HSM proves to be a potentially useful model for understanding how individuals perceive risk. Although the model does vary across the 3 applications enough to justify inclusion of the case as a control variable, relationships among the model's most important constituent variables are generally consistent and strong.

Chauncey Starr has proposed that economic data be used to reveal patterns of acceptable risk-benefit

used to elicit quantitative judgments of perceived risk, acceptable risk, and perceived benefit for each of
30 activities and technologies. The participants were seventy-six members of the League of Women
Voters. The results indicated little systematic relationship between perceived existing risks and benefits
of the 30 risk items. Current risk levels were generally viewed as unacceptably high. When current risk
levels were adjusted to what would be considered acceptable risk levels, however, risk was found to
correlate with benefit. Nine descriptive attributes of risk were also studied. These nine attributes
seemed to tap two basic dimensions of risk. These dimensions proved to be effective predictors of the
tradeoff between acceptable risk and perceived benefit. The limitations of the present study and the
relationship between this technique and Starr's technique are discussed, along with the implications of the
findings for policy decisions.},

	abstract = {Address by Mr. Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, to the 470th Plenary Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday, 8 December 1953, 2:45 p.m.General Assembly President: Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit (India) Madam President and Members of the General Assembly, When Secretary General Hammarskjold's invitation to address the General Assembly reached me in Bermuda, I was just beginning a series of conferences with the prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom and France. Our subject was some of the problems that beset our world. During the remainder of the Bermuda Conference, I had constantly in mind that ahead of me lay a great honour. That honour is mine today as I stand here, privileged to address the General Assembly of the United Nations. At the same time that I appreciate the distinction of addressing you, I have a sense of exhilaration as I look upon this Assembly. Never before in history has so much hope for so many people been gathered together in a single organization. Your deliberations and decisions during these sombre years have already realized part of those hopes. But the great tests and the great accomplishments still lie ahead. And in the confident expectation of those accomplishments, I would use the office which, for the time being, I hold, to assure you that the Government of the United States will remain steadfast in its support of this body. This we shall do in the conviction that you will provide a great share of the wisdom, of the courage and of the faith which can bring to this world lasting peace for all nations, and happiness and well-being for all men. Clearly, it would not be fitting for me to take this occasion to present to you a unilateral American report on Bermuda. Nevertheless, I assure you that in our deliberations on that lovely island we sought to invoke those same great concepts of universal peace and human dignity which are so clearly etched in your Charter. Neither would it be a measure of this great opportunity to recite, however hopefully, pious platitudes. I therefore decided that this occasion warranted my saying to you some of the things that have been on the minds and hearts of my legislative and executive associates, and on mine, for a great many months: thoughts I had originally planned to say primarily to the American people. I know that the American people share my deep belief that if a danger exists in the world, it is a danger shared by all; and equally, that if hope exists in the mind of one nation, that hope should be shared by all. Finally, if there is to be advanced any proposal designed to ease even by the smallest measure the tensions of today's world, what more appropriate audience could there be than the members of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I feel impelled to speak today in a language that in a sense is new, one which I, who have spent so much of my life in the military profession, would have preferred never to use. That new language is the language of atomic warfare. The atomic age has moved forward at such a pace that every citizen of the world should have some comprehension, at least in comparative terms, of the extent of this development, of the utmost significance to every one of us.Clearly, if the peoples of the world are to conduct an intelligent search for peace, they must be armed with the significant facts of today's existence. My recital of atomic danger and power is necessarily stated in United States terms, for these are the only incontrovertible facts that I know, I need hardly point out to this Assembly, however, that this subject is global, not merely national in character. On 16 July 1945, the United States set off the world's biggest atomic explosion. Since that date in 1945, the United States of America has conducted forty-two test explosions. Atomic bombs are more than twenty-five times as powerful as the weapons with which the atomic age dawned, while hydrogen weapons are in the ranges of millions of tons of TNT equivalent. Today, the United States stockpile of atomic weapons, which, of course,increases daily, exceeds by many times the total equivalent of the total of all bombs and all shells that came from every plane and every gun in every theatre of war in all the years of the Second World War. A single air group whether afloat or land based, can now deliver to any reachable target a destructive cargo exceeding in power all the bombs that fell on Britain in all the Second World War. In size and variety, the development of atomic weapons has been no less remarkable. The development has been such that atomic weapons have virtually achieved conventional status within our armed services. In the United States,the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps are all capable of putting this weapon to military use. But the dread secret and the fearful engines of atomic might are not ours alone. In the first place, the secret is possessed by our friends and allies, the United Kingdom and Canada, whose scientific genius made a tremendous contribution to our original discoveries and the designs of atomic bombs. The secret is also known by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has informed us that, over recent years, it has devoted extensive resources to atomic weapons. During this period the Soviet Union has exploded a series of atomic devices, including at least one involving thermo-nuclear reactions. If at one time the United States possessed what might have been called a monopoly of atomic power, that monopoly ceased to exist several years ago.Therefore, although our earlier start has permitted us to accumulate what is today a great quantitative advantage, the atomic realities of today comprehend two facts of even greater significance. First, the knowledge now possessed by several nations will eventually be shared by others, possibly all others. Second, even a vast superiority in numbers of weapons, and a consequent capability of devastating retaliation, is no preventive, of itself, against the fearful material damage and toll of human lives that would be inflicted by surprise aggression. The free world, at least dimly aware of these facts, has naturally embarked on a large programme of warning and defence systems. That programme will be accelerated and extended. But let no one think that the expenditure of vast sums for weapons and systems of defence can guarantee absolute safety for the cities and citizens of any nation. The awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb doesn't permit of any such easy solution. Even against the most powerful defence,an aggressor in possession of the effective minimum number of atomic bombs fora surprise attack could probably place a sufficient number of his bombs on the chosen targets to cause hideous damage. Should such an atomic attack be launched against the United States, our reactions would be swift and resolute. But for me to say that the defence capabilities of the United States are such that they could inflict terrible losses upon an aggressor, for me to say that the retaliation capabilities of the United States are so great that such an aggressor's land would be laid waste, all this, while fact, is not the true expression of the purpose and the hopes of the United States. To pause there would be to confirm the hopeless finality of a belief that two atomic colossi are doomed malevolently to eye each other indefinitely across a trembling world. To stop there would be to accept helplessly the probability of civilization destroyed, the annihilation of the irreplaceable heritage of mankind handed down to us from generation to generation, and the condemnation of mankind to begin all over again the age-old struggle upward from savagery towards decency, and right, and justice. Surely no sane member of the human race could discover victory in such desolation. Could anyone wish his name to be coupled by history with such human degradation and destruction?Occasional pages of history do record the faces of the "great destroyers", but the whole book of history reveals mankind's never-ending quest for peace and mankind's God-given capacity to build. It is with the book of history, and not with isolated pages, that the United States will ever wish to be identified. My country wants to be constructive,not destructive. It wants agreements, not wars, among nations. It wants itself to live in freedom and in the confidence that the peoples of every other nation enjoy equally the right of choosing their own way of life. So my country's purpose is to help us to move out of the dark chamber of horrors into the light, to find a way by which the minds of men, the hopes of men, the souls of men everywhere, can move forward towards peace and happiness and well-being. In this quest, I know that we must not lack patience. I know that in a world divided, such as ours today, salvation cannot be attained by one dramatic act.I know that many steps will have to be taken over many months before the world can look at itself one day and truly realize that a new climate of mutually peaceful confidence is abroad in the world. But I know, above all else, that we must start to take these steps - now. The United States and its allies, the United Kingdom and France, have over the past months tried to take some of these steps. Let no one say that we shun the conference table. On the record has long stood the request of the United States, the United Kingdom and France to negotiate with the Soviet Union the problems of a divided Germany. On that record has long stood the request of the same three nations to negotiate an Austrian peace treaty. On the same record still stands the request of the United Nations to negotiate the problems of Korea. Most recently we have received from the Soviet Union what is in effect an expression of willingness to hold a four-Power meeting. Along with our allies,the United Kingdom and France, we were pleased to see that this note did not contain the unacceptable pre-conditions previously put forward. As you already know from our joint Bermuda communique, the United States, the United Kingdom and France have agreed promptly to meet with the Soviet Union. The Government of the United States approaches this conference with hopeful sincerity. We will bend every effort of our minds to the single purpose of emerging from that conference with tangible results towards peace, the only true way of lessening international tension. We never have, and never will, propose or suggest that the Soviet Union surrender what rightly belongs to it. We will never say that the peoples of the USSR are an enemy with whom we have no desire ever to deal or mingle in friendly and fruitful relationship. On the contrary, we hope that this coming conference may initiate a relationship with the Soviet Union which will eventually bring about a freer mingling of the peoples of the East and of the West - the one sure, human way of developing the understanding required for confident and peaceful relations. Instead of the discontent which is now settling upon Eastern Germany,occupied Austria and the countries of Eastern Europe, we seek a harmonious family of free European nations, with none a threat to the other, and least of all a threat to the peoples of the USSR. Beyond the turmoil and strife and misery of Asis, we seek peaceful opportunity for these peoples to develop their natural resources and to elevate their lot. These are not idle words or shallow visions. Behind them lies a story of nations lately come to independence, not as a result of war, but through free grant or peaceful negotiation. There is a record already written of assistance gladly given by nations of the West to needy peoples and to those suffering the temporary effects of famine, drought and natural disaster. These are deeds of peace. They speak more loudly than promises or protestations of peaceful intent. But I do not wish to rest either upon the reiteration of past proposals or the restatement of past deeds. The gravity of the time is such that every new avenue of peace, no matter how dimly discernible, should be explored. There is at least one new avenue of peace which has not been well explored -an avenue now laid out by the General Assembly of the United Nations. In its resolution of 28 November 1953 (resolution 715 (VIII)) this General Assembly suggested: "that the Disarmament Commission study the desirability of establishing a sub-committee consisting of representatives of the Powers principally involved, which should seek in private an acceptable solution and report...on such a solution to the General Assembly and to the Security Council not later than 1 September 1954. The United States, heeding the suggestion of the General Assembly of the United Nations, is instantly prepared to meet privately with such other countries as may be "principally involved", to seek "an acceptable solution" to the atomic armaments race which overshadows not only the peace, but the very life, of the world. We shall carry into these private or diplomatic talks a new conception. The United States would seek more than the mere reduction or elimination of atomic materials for military purposes. It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace. The United States knows that if the fearful trend of atomic military build-up can be reversed, this greatest of destructive forces can be developed into a great boon, for the benefit of all mankind. The United States knows that peaceful power from atomic energy is no dream of the future. The capability,already proved, is here today. Who can doubt that, if the entire body of the world's scientists and engineers had adequate amounts of fissionable material with which to test and develop their ideas, this capability would rapidly be transformed into universal, efficient and economic usage? To hasten the day when fear of the atom will begin to disappear from the minds the people and the governments of the East and West, there are certain steps that can be taken now. I therefore make the following proposal. The governments principally involved, to the extent permitted by elementary prudence, should begin now and continue to make joint contributions from their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials to an international atomic energy agency. We would expect that such an agency would be set up under the aegis of the United Nations. The ratios of contributions, the procedures and other details would properly be within the scope of the "private conversations" I referred to earlier. The United States is prepared to undertake these explorations in good faith.Any partner of the United States acting in the same good faith will find the United States a not unreasonable or ungenerous associate. Undoubtedly, initial and early contributions to this plan would be small in quantity. However, the proposal has the great virtue that it can be undertaken without the irritations and mutual suspicions incident to any attempt to set up a completely acceptable system of world-wide inspection and control. The atomic energy agency could be made responsible for the impounding,storage and protection of the contributed fissionable and other materials. The ingenuity of our scientists will provide special safe conditions under which such a bank of fissionable material can be made essentially immune to surprise seizure. The more important responsibility of this atomic energy agency would be to devise methods whereby this fissionable material would be allocated to serve the peaceful pursuits of mankind. Experts would be mobilized to apply atomic energy to the needs of agriculture, medicine and other peaceful activities. A special purpose would be to provide abundant electrical energy in the power-starved areas of the world. Thus the contributing Powers would be dedicating some of their strength to serve the needs rather than the fears of mankind. The United States would be more than willing - it would be proud to take up with others "principally involved" the development of plans whereby such peaceful use of atomic energy would be expedited. Of those "principally involved" the Soviet Union must, of course, be one. I would be prepared to submit to the Congress of the United States, and with every expectation of approval, any such plan that would, first, encourage world-wide investigation into the most effective peacetime uses of fissionable material, and with the certainty that the investigators had all the material needed for the conducting of all experiments that were appropriate; second,begin to diminish the potential destructive power of the world's atomic stockpiles; third, allow all peoples of all nations to see that, in this enlightened age, the great Powers of the earth, both of the East and of the West, are interested in human aspirations first rather than in building up the armaments of war; fourth, open up a new channel for peaceful discussion and initiative at least a new approach to the many difficult problems that must be solved in both private and public conversations if the world is to shake off the inertia imposed by fear and is to make positive progress towards peace. Against the dark background of the atomic bomb, the United States does not wish merely to present strength, but also the desire and the hope for peace.The coming months will be fraught with fateful decisions. In this Assembly, in the capitals and military headquarters of the world, in the hearts of men everywhere, be they governed or governors, may they be the decisions which will lead this world out of fear and into peace. To the making of these fateful decisions, the United States pledges before you, and therefore before the world, its determination to help solve the fearful atomic dilemma - to devote its entire heart and mind to finding the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life. I again thank representatives for the great honour they have done me in inviting me to appear before them and in listening to me so graciously.},

Participants perceived nuclear accidents as a major risk, but such perceptions were sometimes based on misunderstandings. The findings suggested that participants evaluated trust toward relevant stakeholders based on their expertise, transparency, and empathy. Overall, participants indicated that their respective countries were not ready for nuclear energy: The Thais thought that their government should heighten public education on nuclear energy, while the Vietnamese thought that their country lacked expertise for managing nuclear power plants. This study also highlights the theoretical and policy implications for nuclear energy development in Southeast Asia. Directions for future studies were discussed.},

Considering the emerging regional salience of nuclear energy, this study seeks to understand the public’s media consumption patterns regarding nuclear-related information, and credibility perceptions of nuclear-related information sources in countries that are at a nascent stage of nuclear development. Focus groups were conducted with citizens aged between 18 and 69 from five Southeast Asian countries – Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Overall, the findings suggest that the participants utilize communication channels in a complementary manner to receive and seek nuclear-related information. Participants also evaluated the credibility of individuals and organizations that convey nuclear-related information based on their trustworthiness and nuclear expertise. The findings provide practical implications in terms of policy implementation, as well as public communication of nuclear-related information. Directions for future research were also discussed.},

	abstract = {A review of the recent literature concerning Internet usage among Americans reveals that the
once stark gender gap is closing rapidly, but disparities remain in the purposes for which
males and females use the Internet. Almost all of this research, however, is based on cross
sections of American adults. Much less Internet research has focused on the college student
population and, in particular, on female students; the few published studies show that female college students use the Internet less than males. However, even these recent studies
may already be dated. This study, based on a large survey of college students from institutions of higher learning in Georgia, Hawaii, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island,
considers these questions: (1) Has the gender gap in Internet use narrowed among college
students to the same extent as it has in the general adult population? (2) Do female students
differ from males in how they spend their time on the Internet? (3) Does family income,
parental education or type of college influence female college students’ use of the Internet?
Results indicate that while the gender gap in use of the Internet has nearly closed, differences still remain in how male and female undergraduates use the Internet.},

Since this systematic bias in scientific information and recognition practices fits the second half of Matthew 13:12 in the Bible, which refers to the under-recognition accorded to those who have little to start with, it is suggested that sociologists of science and knowledge can add to the 'Matthew Effect', made famous by Robert K. Merton in 1968, the 'Matilda Effect', named for the American suffragist and feminist critic Matilda J. Gage of New York, who in the late nineteenth century both experienced and articulated this phenomenon. Calling attention to her and this age-old tendency may prod future scholars to include other such 'Matildas' and thus to write a better, because more comprehensive, history and sociology of science.},

	abstract = {Globalization has resulted in multi-cultural and diverse workforces across the globe. Diversity in a workplace increases adaptability amongst employees; different talents of various individuals have become great resources, which also result in a pool of unique contributions. As a diverse genders and culture comes together, it provides a spectrum of viewpoints to meet objectives and accomplish goals. Thus diverse work force is an environment where people accept differences rather than deny them. If we pay attention to gender differences, we just might untangle the gender communications knots and get the job done faster and make working environment hassle free. Successful organizations need to create effective communication within a diverse workforce. In order to do so, it is necessary to focus on the gender differences in communication patterns. Overlooking the differences between the two gender roles can cause confusion and biases thus consequently having a negative impact on the overall organizational performance. However, gender issues arising from misunderstanding could be reduced within the organization by establishing equilibrium between men and women. The only way to have a healthy working atmosphere within an organization is to identify the differences and find ways to bridge the communication gulf between the sexes. Through two quizzes an attempt has been made in this work to explore different approaches followed by male and female associates to communicate in an organization.},

We focus on the climate change debate on Twitter and combine network analysis with automated content analysis. The results show that scientists interact most intensively with their peers, but also communication beyond the scientific community is important. The findings suggest that scientists adjust their communication style to their audience: They use more neutral language when communicating with other scientists, and more words expressing negative emotions when communicating with journalists, civil society, and politicians. Likewise, they stress certainty more when communicating with politicians, indicating that scientists use language strategically when communicating beyond the scientific community.},

Using an online survey, we asked participants about their experiences with multiple forms of mediated communication: social networking sites, e-mail, video calls, instant messaging, texting, and phone calls. Our results indicated that women, compared to men, are generally more frequent mediated communication users. Compared to men, women prefer and more frequently use text messaging, social media, and online video calls. These results suggest that the nature of mediated social interaction is changing.

Examining two recent cases of what are defined as “toxic technocultures” (\#Gamergate and The Fappening), this work describes how Reddit’s design, algorithm, and platform politics implicitly support these kinds of cultures. In particular, this piece focuses on the ways in which Reddit’s karma point system, aggregation of material across subreddits, ease of subreddit and user account creation, governance structure, and policies around offensive content serve to provide fertile ground for anti-feminist and misogynistic activism. The ways in which these events and communities reflect certain problematic aspects of geek masculinity are also considered. This research is informed by the results of a long-term participant-observation and ethnographic study into Reddit’s culture and community and is grounded in actor-network theory.},

This article analyzes public outreach and engagement attitudes and activities of women scientists; it is based on a case study conducted in Switzerland. The survey results found that attitudes toward public outreach and engagement activities are the same among men and women scientists, but that activities are done significantly more often by men scientists than by women scientists. A multivariate analysis showed that there is a gender difference in the level of activities even after the effects of position, age, and faculty are removed. Because public outreach and engagement activities may be due to either scientists’ initiatives or media initiatives, the author analyzed media contacts. The media contact women scientists less often than men scientists—and this independently of position, age, and faculty. When comparing men’s and women’s improvements for public outreach and engagement, this study found significant differences that can be used to tailor incentives for each group of scientists.},

Study 1 showed that feminine STEM role models reduced middle school girls’ current math interest, self-rated ability, and success expectations relative to gender-neutral STEM role models and depressed future plans to study math among STEM-disidentified girls. These results did not extend to feminine role models displaying general (not STEM-specific) school success, indicating that feminine cues were not driving negative outcomes. Study 2 suggested that feminine STEM role models’ combination of femininity and success seemed particularly unattainable to STEM-disidentified girls.

In the process, these scientists strategically chose different social media platforms to increase controllability. Despite their preference for the approach of knowledge dissemination rather than dialogues, Chinese scientists tried to avoid the bureaucratic practice of science communication, and instead, they promoted some level of public participation.},

Using the qualitative method of thematic analysis and collecting data through semistructured interviews of 14 practitioners of diverse professions, backgrounds, ages, and stages of career, it was found that the role of marine scientists in this area is traditionally viewed as reduced, but with a slight improvement in the past 5 to 10 years. Despite having a historical connection with and curiosity about the sea, audiences were considered to have a mostly utilitarian interest in the marine sciences. Most practitioners had a view of science communication connected to the knowledge deficit model, with a minority articulating a more dialogical model. Although there are signs of conflict between science communicators and scientists, the proliferation of training opportunities in science communication at the national level, the perceived increase of interest and participation of marine scientists in public communication in the past years, and the consolidation of science communicators as part of the scientific community offer positive prospects for the future of outreach of marine sciences in Portugal.},

Our analysis reveals the asymmetrical ways in which men and women working in science, engineering and technology are portrayed, in particular through the emphasis on women’s appearance and a focus on their exceptional status. It also highlights the way female scientists may be used to “sex up” the discipline in the context of increasing concern about the (un)popularity of science. This media analysis is contextualized by drawing on data from 86 scientists examining how women themselves experience press and television coverage and address the cultural contradictions surrounding their role. The research highlights the challenges facing women working in these fields and the dilemmas for those seeking to develop a “human” face for science and promote a positive image for women.},

The findings indicate that green marketing strategy led firms to improve their profitability by optimizing marketing performance and reducing costs. However, dimensions of organizational results, like process performance, are not positively related to economic success.

Using data from two experimental studies with quota-based samples in the United States (N = 486) and Germany (N = 300), we compare nondeceptive claims with two types of claims often used in greenwashing: vague claims and false claims. We also identify the presence of pleasant nature-evoking images and test for interaction effects with two types of environmental involvement: environmental concern and environmental knowledge. Results indicate that while vague claims do not enhance consumers' perceived greenwashing regardless of their environmental knowledge or concern, false claims do, which consequently harms consumers' attitudes toward those ads and brands. In the United States, consumers' environmental knowledge moderates that effect, whereas all consumers in Germany could identify false claims as attempts at greenwashing. Moreover, associating greenwashing claims with nature-evoking images activates an affective persuasive mechanism that appeals to consumers' affinity for nature, which not only positively influences their evaluations of ads and brands but also influences their attitudes toward ads and brands more strongly than perceived greenwashing. In closing, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.},

Last October Los Alamos Science invited Laboratory physicists, mathematicians, biologists, chemists, and computer scientists to discuss these questions in an open forum. To add historical perspective and a little more spice, we invited Harold Agnew to join us. Harold began his career at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project and was director of the Laboratory from 1970 to 1979. He became president of General Atomic Company after leaving Los Alamos and is now retired. He is known for his candor, his enthusiasm for nuclear energy, his pride in Los Alamos, and his strength as a leader. Harold very effectively encouraged the participants to express their diverse interests and opinions. Here we present a condensed version of the day-long discussion.},

	abstract = {This essay presents an aesthetic theory based on the coevolution of the biological and cultural elements of the human nervous system. If the evolution of our sense of beauty is a nonlinear feedback between cultural and biological determinants, recent developments in the theory of chaos, nonlinear processes, and self-organizing systems can point the way to a better understanding of aesthetics. The experience of beauty is redescribed as a reward analogous to the neurochemical rewards for other adaptive activities such as eating and sex. Beauty itself is broadly redefined as an objective property of the fundamental generative processes of the universe—thus as possessing a real, not just a subjective, existence. Like our eyes, our aesthetic sense is designed to perceive objects that are actually out there: systems which show promise for emergent forms of order. The ability to recognize such systems would have adaptive significance. The “natural classical” genres or “neurocharms” of the arts, such as poetic meter and visual pattern, are techniques for controlling and creating such emergence-promising systems, and are culturally universal. A new theory of meaning is proposed, using recent developments in the theory of chaotically-oscillating neural circuits in the brain. Words do not indicate the absence of their referents, as in poststructuralist theory; instead, as emergent strange attractors in the brain, they participate in complex nonlinear physical feedback relationships with their referents.},

	abstract = {Of all the online information tools that the public relies on to collect information and share opinions about scientific and environmental issues, Twitter presents a unique venue to assess the spontaneous and genuine opinions of networked publics, including those about a focusing event like the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Using computational linguistic algorithms, this study analyzes a census of English-language tweets about nuclear power before, during, and after the Fukushima nuclear accident. Results show that although discourse about the event may have faded rapidly from the news cycle on traditional media, it evoked concerns about reactor safety and the environmental implications of nuclear power, particularly among users in U.S. states that are geographically closer to the accident site. Also, while the sentiment of the tweets was primarily pessimistic about nuclear power weeks after the accident, overall sentiment became increasingly neutral and uncertain over time. This study reveals there is a group of concerned citizens and stakeholders who are using online tools like Twitter to communicate about global and local environmental and health risks related to nuclear power. The implications for risk communication and public engagement strategies are discussed.},

	abstract = {Aim
This study examines risk perceptions toward nuclear power before and after the Fukushima Daiichi disaster using nationally representative survey samples of American adults.
Scope
On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 8.4 earthquake, the largest in the nation's history, occurred off the coast of Japan. The earthquake produced a devastating tsunami that flooded areas of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and resulted in a loss of power to the plant's cooling system. In the weeks that followed, the world watched as Japanese and international nuclear power safety experts scrambled to contain the damage and prevent a full meltdown. Although the Fukushima Daiichi disaster was heavily covered in media, there is little empirical research on how this coverage impacted audience risk perceptions. Our analysis goes beyond examining aggregate risk perceptions, instead focusing on how specific sub-populations responded to the disaster.
Conclusion
We found that ideological groups responded differently to the events in Japan. In particular, risk perceptions among conservatives decreased following the incident. Moreover, we found that media use exacerbated these effects. We discuss possible explanations for these findings.},

In Twitter, retweeting is the most important information propagation mechanism, and supernodes (news medias) that have many followers are the most important information sources. Therefore, it is important to understand the news retweet propagation from supernodes and predict news popularity quickly at the very ﬁrst few seconds upon publishing. Such understanding and prediction will beneﬁt many applications such as social media management, advertisement and interaction optimization between news medias and followers. In this paper, we identify the characteristics of news propagation from supernodes from the trace data we crawled from Twitter. Based on the characteristics, we build a news popularity prediction model that can predict the ﬁnal number of retweets of a news tweet very quickly. Through trace-driven experiments, we then validate our prediction model by comparing our predicted popularity and real popularity, and show its superior performance in comparison with the regression prediction model. From the study, we found that the average interaction frequency between the retweeters and the news source is correlated with news popularity. Also, the negative sentiment of news has some correlations with retweet popularity while the positive sentiment of news does not have such obvious correlation.},

Is it possible to predict whether a tweet will become "viral", i.e., will be frequently retweeted? To answer these questions we provide an extensive analysis of a wide range of tweet and user features regarding their influence on the spread of tweets. The most impactful features are chosen to build a learning model that predicts viral tweets with high accuracy.

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

	abstract = {The IAEA’s Department of Safeguards has embarked on an evolutionary process to more fully develop and apply the State-level concept for safeguards implementation. In an attempt to direct safeguards to areas of greatest proliferation risk, this concept makes use of all safeguards-relevant information available in order to focus and prior- itize its safeguards activities for a State.
A key component is the development of a State-level Approach which consists of ana- lyzing acquisition paths, establishing and prioritizing technical objectives, and identi- fying applicable safeguards measures. The methodology to accomplish this is based on a three-step-approach: network modeling, network analysis, and strategic assessment. The network modeling step assesses and formalizes the State’s nuclear capabilities as well as other state-specific factors concerning relevant proliferation scenarios. The network analysis step gives a ranking of all plausible acquisition paths including a visualization of the paths. Finally, the strategic assessment evaluates the State’s pro- liferation and compliance options as well as the IAEA’s set of technical objectives and subsequent safeguards measures.
In this paper, a hypothetical State model was developed in order to test the method- ology’s performance. Therefore, an Excel spreadsheet with all necessary state-level factors has been created. Afterwards, a Python software module based on graph the- oretical algorithms was applied to produce a comprehensive list of ranked acquisition paths including their visualization. The following step of the strategic evaluation is mainly based on the concept of the Nash equilibrium resulting in a stable combination of the State’s and the IAEA’s strategies. This formal and automatic procedure o↵ers the advantage of gaining results in a comprehensive and non-discriminative manner.},

Despite abundant reports documenting successful plant exportation, it is difficult to obtain official accounts that reveal the main factors that lead to successful export due to the secretive nature of nuclear power plant contracts. This study developed a model comparing the competitiveness between nuclear power plant supplier countries. The model 1) categorizes and classifies various criteria for nuclear power plant export and 2) assigns weighted values on each criterion based on an AHP analysis to 3) compare the competitiveness of the export-capable countries based on the developed framework. The analysis showed that China has the highest competitiveness followed by Russia, Korea, the United States, Japan, and France, in decreasing order. In this context, it is imperative for Korea to construct consumer oriented export packages and target countries with strong leadership, countries that disregard the nuclear fuel cycle, countries that require fast nuclear power plant adoption, or countries that are pro-American.},

	abstract = {There are two sets of principles involved in the development of the gas centrifuge, the internal separation physics and the external means of spinning a rotor at very high speeds. Only the first aspect is discussed in this part of the review. First, the industrial requirement for the separation of the uranium isotopes is defined so that the separation history can be put in a modern perspective. The history of separation physics itself is then traced back to the theory of centrifugal force by Huygens and the equivalence of this force to that of gravity. The barometric equation giving the variation of atmospheric pressure with height and the law of partial pressures can then be adapted to the centrifuge to give the steady-state theory of separation. This work was completed in the last century but was not confirmed in its application to isotope separation until 1936. The detailed separation physics for non-steady-state conditions required for a production centrifuge was developed during the American wartime Manhattan Project. During this work the theory giving the maximum output of a centrifuge was developed by Dirac, and soon afterwards Cohen and Kaplan showed that the best method of operation for a production centrifuge is in a countercurrent mode of operation. This method gives a large separation factor at relatively small flow rates through the rotor. The theory of how to set up an internal countercurrent was given by Martin during an equivalent wartime German project, and refinements to the theory, showing how the countercurrent persists along a centrifuge rotor, was given by Dirac and Steenbeck, the latter during a postwar Russian project. This theory was extended by Parker, Ging, and Mayo of the University of Virginia, whose work was completed by 1962, the limit of this review.},

	abstract = {This article gives a historical and technical review of the U.S. gas centrifuge efforts between 1934 and 1985. The first section tells of how the United States initially led in centrifuge design, only to abandon the still-immature technology in the midst of the Manhattan Project. While interest in the technology continued in Europe, the United States decided that centrifuges were not a viable alternative to existing gaseous-diffusion plants. Five years later, U.S. spies learned of important Soviet achievements in centrifuge design, which, it appeared, might place centrifuges in direct competition with gaseous diffusion. When combined with European enthusiasm for the centrifuge, the United States faced the prospect of losing its control on the enrichment market in the West. Accordingly, the United States organized a program to rebuild its centrifuge dominance. Over the next 25 years, it led the world in machine performance but ultimately failed to commercialize its designs for a variety of reasons. The basic specifications and performance data for several of the U.S. centrifuges designed and tested during these years are reported here for the first time in the public domain. The United States also made a number of contributions in the theoretical domain that were openly shared over the course of the U.S. program. Most of these fell into the field of fluid dynamics, developed to guide the design and optimization of centrifuges. The most important elements, especially those relating to the calculation of separative power, are described in Theoretical Developments. These are of interest to policy-makers because they can be used to predict the rate at which centrifuges produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, an important factor for nuclear nonproliferation. They are also used in calculations related to multi-isotope separation, which is important for nuclear forensics. Examples of both kinds of policy analysis are given in articles by Glaser 1 and Wood 2 appearing in an earlier issue of Science and Global Security. The U.S. theory is used here to derive a simple equation that enables policy-makers to make good estimates for the separative power of a real centrifuge by knowing only its length and speed.},

	abstract = {Presently, the gas centrifuge arranged in cascades is the most common method for enriching uranium in its fissionable isotope, 235U.  The enriching process can be modeled in two overarching steps.  First, one examines the individual centrifuge machines, estimating enriching performance based on operating conditions such as the centrifuge feed flow rate and cut.  Second, this information is built into a cascade analysis which considers the cascade structure (how the machines are linked together) as well as the total cascade feed, product, and waste flow rates.  This paper, which focuses on the second half of the modeling process, outlines a method for analyzing one centrifuge cascade structure recently developed and implemented by Iran.  The novel configuration consists of two conventional cascades interconnected in a tandem fashion.  In this arrangement, the waste flow from the first cascade enters the second cascade as feed flow.  The waste leaving this (the second) cascade becomes the overall waste flow and the associated product is reintroduced into the first cascade.  Because the two cascades are linked – the flow leaving the first cascade affects the operation of the second cascade, and vice versa – the traditional method for analyzing single cascades is inadequate.  This paper presents an extension of the conventional analysis procedure that is appropriate for tandem cascades.  The new method is used to assess Iran’s tandem cascades, including their utility for producing highly-enriched uranium for nuclear weapons.},

	abstract = {Centrifuge performance maps are useful for characterizing the separation parameters of a particular centrifuge over a range of operating parameters such as feed rate and cut. Typically, to develop a performance map, the internal hydrodynamics and isotope diffusion must be modeled, requiring knowledge of the centrifuge geometry and operating conditions. Due to the sensitive nature of centrifuge information, these parameters are usually not available. In some cases, some information about the performance of the centrifuge may be inferred from publicly available information. In these cases, a method for estimating the centrifuge performance over a range of operating conditions can be useful.

In this paper, a semi-empirical method for developing a centrifuge performance map from known performance data is presented. The method is based on analyzing the centrifuge as a square cascade with three characterizing parameters. To verify the model, centrifuge separative power and separation factor are compared with results from the Pancake code over a range of feed rates and cuts. A cascade level comparison is used to further compare the two models. The comparison shows that the semi-empirical model is in good agreement with the Pancake code for most cases.},

	title = {Uranium {Enrichment} and {Nuclear} {Weapons} {Proliferation}},
	abstract = {In the years following World War 11,when gaseous diffusion was the only practical means of enriching uranium, the potential contribution of uranium enrichment to weapon proliferation seemed small. It was assumed that gaseous diffusion plants were so technically complex and costly that only the most wealthy, industrialized countries could afford them. The potential for the diversion of plutonium to weapon use seemed far more dangerous and received far more attention from people concerned about weapon proliferation.


However, during the past 20 years there has been a steadily accelerating technological advance across the broad spectrum of enrich- ment technology. These developments have made the enrichment route to proliferation more accessible to smaller, poorer and less technically advanced countries. This has in no way reduced the danger associated with plutonium, but has instead added a new set of dangers and problems for those who would attempt to stop and reverse the spread of nuclear weapons.

This book presents a comprehensive review of the state of the art of enrichment technology and attempts to evaluate the impact of this technology on the proliferation problem. It places the technical develop- ment into ihe context of the economic and institutional environment within which the enrichment industry has evolved to its present state, and it suggests some measures which might be taken to reduce the proliferation dangers inherent in this industry.},

However, this 12 month criteria does not hold if Iran were to re-install the advanced IR-2m centrifuges during a breakout.  Breakout timelines of seven months result if these centrifuges are re-installed.  The U.S. administration makes the assessment that Iran will not re-install these centrifuges because they are unreliable and work poorly.  This assessment preserves a 12-month breakout timeline but it appears questionable.  The JCPOA has many strengths but one of its most serious shortcomings is that it almost ensures that Iran can emerge in 15-20 years as a nuclear power with the potential, at a time of its choosing, to make enough weapon-grade uranium for several nuclear weapons within a few weeks.  Addressing this weakness, in particular by finding ways to ensure Iran does not build a semi-commercial enrichment program, should become a critical part of the implementation of the JCPOA and not left to future generations of decision makers.},

Acquisition Path Analysis (APA) is central to the SLC and the development of State-level approaches (SLAs). APA offers the Agency the ability to structure its activities in a manner that focuses on the State as a whole and integrates in-field inspection and state evaluation efforts. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has developed a model approach for ranking paths and focusing safeguards activities. This paper will focus on the development and use of performance targets in the SLC and the bounded flexibility they provide. The adoption of performance requirements for covering acquisition paths can address the shortcomings of prescriptive approaches while promoting a safeguards system that is focused on achieving objectives rather than simply performing tasks. This more dynamic safeguards system can be used to improve effectiveness and better utilize the expertise of Agency staff, and should ultimately contribute to increased confidence in safeguard conclusions. Performance targets also provide a means for reporting on the performance of the safeguards system by characterizing the strength of path coverage it has been designed to provide.},

The instrument's validity was supported with contrasted-groups and developmental-age progression comparisons, as well as factor analyses.

The plant operators must work to mitigate the accident with limited experience and guidance for the situation. The SMART (Safely Managing Accidental Reactor Transients) procedures framework aims to fill the need for detailed guidance by creating a comprehensive probabilistic model, using a Dynamic Bayesian Network, to aid in the diagnosis of the reactor’s state. In this paper, we explore the vi- ability of the proposed SMART proceedures approach by building a prototype Bayesian network that allows for the diagnosis of two types of accidents based on a comprehensive data set. We use Kullback-Leibler (K- L) divergence to gauge the relative importance of each of the plant’s parameters. We compare accuracy and F- score measures across four different Bayesian networks: a baseline network that ignores observation variables, a network that ignores data from the observation vari- able with the highest K-L score, a network that ignores data from the variable with the lowest K-L score, and finally a network that includes all observation variable data. We conclude with an interpretation of these results for SMART procedures.},

	abstract = {MCNP is a general-purpose Monte Carlo N-Particle code that can be used for neutron, photon, electron, or coupled neutron/photon/electron transport. Specific areas of application include, but are not limited to, radiation protection and dosimetry, radiation shielding, radiography, medical physics, nuclear criticality safety, Detector Design and analysis, nuclear oil well logging, Accelerator target design, Fission and fusion reactor design, decontamination and decommissioning. The code treats an arbitrary three-dimensional configuration of materials in geometric cells bounded by first- and second-degree surfaces and fourth-degree elliptical tori.

Pointwise cross-section data typically are used, although group-wise data also are available. For neutrons, all reactions given in a particular cross-section evaluation (such as ENDF/B-VI) are accounted for. Thermal neutrons are described by both the free gas and S(alpha,beta) models. For photons, the code accounts for incoherent and coherent scattering, the possibility of fluorescent emission after photoelectric absorption, absorbtion in pair production with local emission of annihilation radiation, and bremsstrahlung. A continuous-slowing-down model is used for electron transport that includes positrons, k x-rays, and bremsstrahlung but does not include external or self-induced fields.

Important standard features that make MCNP very versatile and easy to use include a powerful general source, criticality source, and surface source; both geometry and output tally plotters; a rich collection of variance reduction techniques; a flexible tally structure; and an extensive collection of cross-section data.

MCNP contains numerous flexible tallies: surface current \& flux, volume flux (track length), point or ring detectors, particle heating, fission heating, pulse height taly for energy or charge deposition, mesh tallies, and radiography tallies.},

Version 2.2 was the first update to ORIGEN2 in over 10 years and was stimulated by a user discovering a discrepancy in the mass of fission products calculated using ORIGEN2 V2.1. Code modifications, as well as reducing the irradiation time step to no more than 100 days/step reduced the discrepancy from {\textasciitilde}10\% to 0.16\%. The bug does not noticeably affect the fission product mass in typical ORIGEN2 calculations involving reactor fuels because essentially all of the fissions come from actinides that have explicit fission product yield libraries. Thus, most previous ORIGEN2 calculations that were otherwise set up properly should not be affected.},

	abstract = {A review of existing analysis codes for nuclear fuel cycle systems was performed to determine if any existing codes meet technical and functional requirements defined for a U.S. national program supporting the global and domestic assessment, development, and deployment of nuclear energy systems. The program would be implemented using an interconnected architecture of different codes ranging from the fuel cycle analysis code, which is the subject of the review, to fundamental physical and mechanistic codes. Four main functions are defined for the code. Function 1 is the ability to characterize and deploy individual fuel cycle facilities and reactors in a simulation while discretely tracking material movements. Function 2 is the capability to perform an uncertainty analysis for each element of the fuel cycle and an aggregate uncertainty analysis. Function 3 is the inclusion of an optimization engine able to optimize simultaneously across multiple objective functions. Function 4 is open and accessible code software and documentation to aid in collaboration between multiple entities and to facilitate software updates.

Existing codes, categorized as annualized or discrete fuel tracking codes, were assessed according to the four functions and associated requirements. These codes were developed by various government, education, and industrial entities to fulfill particular needs. In some cases, decisions were made during code development to limit the level of detail included in a code to ease its use or to focus on certain aspects of a fuel cycle to address specific questions. The review revealed that while no two of the codes are identical, they all perform many of the same basic functions. No code was able to perform defined function 2 or several requirements of functions 1 and 3. Based on this review, it was concluded that the functions and requirements will be met only with development of a new code, referred to as GENIUS.},

	abstract = {The vision of a nuclear renaissance has highlighted the issue of proliferation resistance. The prospects for a dramatic growth in nuclear power may depend on the effectiveness of, and the resources devoted to, plans to develop and implement technologies and approaches that strengthen proliferation resistance. The GenIV International Forum (GIF) and others have devoted attention and resources to proliferation resistance. However, the hope of finding a way to make the peaceful uses of nuclear energy resistant to proliferation has reappeared again and again in the history of nuclear power with little practical consequence. The concept of proliferation resistance has usually focused on intrinsic (technological) as opposed to extrinsic (institutional) factors. However, if there are benefits that may yet be realized from reactors and other facilities designed to minimize proliferation risks, it is their coupling with effective safeguards and other nonproliferation measures that likely be critical. Proliferation resistance has also traditionally been applied only to state threats. Although there are no technologies that can wholly eliminate the risk of proliferation by a determined state, technology can play a limited role in reducing state threats and perhaps in eliminating many non-state threats. These and other issues are not academic. They affect efforts to evaluate proliferation resistance, including the methodology developed by GIF's Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection (PR\&PP) Working Group as well as the proliferation resistance
initiatives that are being pursued or may be developed in the future. This paper will offer a new framework for thinking about proliferation resistance issues, including the ways the output of the methodology could be developed to inform the decisions that states, the International Atomic Energy (lAEA) and others will have to make in order to fully realize the promise of a nuclear renaissance.},

characteristics of Generation IV systems, both technical and  institutional, are used to
evaluate the response of the system and determine its resistance against proliferation threats and robustness against sabotage and terrorism threats. The outcomes of the system response are expressed in terms of six measures for PR and three measures for PP, which are the high-level PR\&PP pathway characteristics of the NES. The
methodology is organized to allow evaluations to be performed at the earliest stages of system design and to become more detailed and more representative as design progresses. Uncertainty of results is recognized and incorporated into the evaluation at
all stages. The results are intended for three types of users: system designers, program policy makers, and external stakeholders. Program policy makers will be more likely to be interested in the high-level results that discriminate among choices, while system designers and safeguards experts will be more interested in results that directly relate to design options that will improve PR\&PP performance (e.g., Safeguards by Design) of the NES.},

	abstract = {New developments on COSI6, the simulation software for fuel cycle analysis 'COSI', is a code simulating a pool of nuclear electricity generating plants with its associated fuel cycle facilities. This code has been designed to study various short, medium and long term options for the introduction of various types of nuclear reactors and for the use of associated nuclear materials. COSI calculates the mass and the isotopic composition of all the materials, in each part of the nuclear park, at any time. Following the complete renewal of the code in 2006, new developments have been implemented into improve physical models, user convenience and to enlarge the scope of utilisation. COSI can now be coupled with CESAR 5 (JEFF 2.2: 200 FP available), allowing to perform waste packages calculations: high level waste (glasses), intermediate level waste (compacted waste), liquid and gaseous waste coming from processing, reactor high level waste. Those packages are managed in new kinds of facilities: finished warehouse, interim storage, waste disposal. The calculable features for waste packages are: mass (initial heavy metal), isotopic content, packages mass, packages volume, number of packages, activity, radiotoxicity, decay heat, necessary area. Developments on COSI are still ongoing. The reactivity equivalence function (based on Baker formula) is now available: - for thorium cycle: compositions for [Th+Pu] or [Th+U] can be calculated taking into account all nuclides impacts. - for ADS: compositions for [MA+Pu] can be calculated taking into account all nuclides impacts. The physical model is also developed: nuclear data (branching ratios, fission energies, fission yields) will be different between thermal reactors and fast reactors. The first step towards proliferation resistance methodology implementation is the evaluation of physical data needed for proliferation evaluation: heating rate from Pu in material (Watt/kg), weight fraction of even isotopes, concentration (SQs/MT), radiation dose rates (rem/hr at a distance of 1 meter), inventory (Significant Quantities). Those results allows to assess proliferation resistance of fuel cycle or to implement an integrated method. The coupling between COSI6 and ERANOS is on the way: the initial composition of fuel is given to MACCAO software, MACCAO builds an ERANOS input mixing it and a reference case, ERANOS is run and the results returns to COSI. This coupling will be a reference calculation way, which provides other results like end-of-cycle reactivity or core dynamic coefficients. For international collaboration COSI is available in French language or English language, with total compatibility of data sets. COSI is used in France, Italy and Germany within licence agreements. COSI utilisation involves a nice graphical user interface, including graphical post processing. The next evolution will include the coupling with CESAR5.3 (JEFF3.1 nuclear data). Examples of studies and results obtained with COSI are presented in the paper. Specific papers about scenario studies made with COSI are also presented.

	abstract = {The purpose of this document is to provide a guide for using the current version of the Verifiable Fuel Cycle Simulation (VISION) model. This is a complex model with many parameters; the user is strongly encouraged to read this user guide before attempting to run the model. This model is an R and D work in progress and may contain errors and omissions. It is based upon numerous assumptions. This model is intended to assist in evaluating 'what if' scenarios and in comparing fuel, reactor, and fuel processing alternatives at a systems level for U.S. nuclear power. The model is not intended as a tool for process flow and design modeling of specific facilities nor for tracking individual units of fuel or other material through the system. The model is intended to examine the interactions among the components of a fuel system as a function of time varying system parameters; this model represents a dynamic rather than steady-state approximation of the nuclear fuel system. VISION models the nuclear cycle at the system level, not individual facilities, e.g., 'reactor types' not individual reactors and 'separation types' not individual separation plants. Natural uranium can be enriched, which produces enriched uranium, which goes into fuel fabrication, and depleted uranium (DU), which goes into storage. Fuel is transformed (transmuted) in reactors and then goes into a storage buffer. Used fuel can be pulled from storage into either separation of disposal. If sent to separations, fuel is transformed (partitioned) into fuel products, recovered uranium, and various categories of waste. Recycled material is stored until used by its assigned reactor type. Note that recovered uranium is itself often partitioned: some RU flows with recycled transuranic elements, some flows with wastes, and the rest is designated RU. RU comes out of storage if needed to correct the U/TRU ratio in new recycled fuel. Neither RU nor DU are designated as wastes. VISION is comprised of several Microsoft Excel input files, a Powersim Studio core, and several Microsoft Excel output files. All must be co-located in the same folder on a PC to function. We use Microsoft Excel 2003 and have not tested VISION with Microsoft Excel 2007. The VISION team uses both Powersim Studio 2005 and 2009 and it should work with either.},

	title = {Fuel cycle options for optimized recycling of nuclear fuel},
	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/42340},
	abstract = {The accumulation of transuranic inventories in spent nuclear fuel depends on both deployment of advanced reactors that can be loaded with recycled transuranics (TRU), and on availability of the facilities that separate and reprocess spent fuel. Three recycling strategies are explored in this study: (1) Recycling in thermal Light 'Water Reactors (LWR) using CONFU technology (COmbined Non-Fertile and UO2 fuel), (2) recycling of TRU in fast cores of Actinide Burner Reactors (ABR), and (3) recycling of TRU with UO2 in self-sustaining Gas-cooled Fast Reactors (GFR). Choosing one fuel cycle strategy over the others involves trade-offs that need to be quantified. The CONFU, ABR, and GFR strategies differ from each other in terms of TRU loading in the reactor, net TRU incineration, capacities of recycling facilities needed, technology option availability, and flexibility. The CONFU and GFR are assumed to achieve zero net TRU incineration, while the ABR is a net consumer of TRU. The TRU loading is greatest in GFR and lowest in CONFU. While both CONFU and ABR require separation (of TRU from U) and reprocessing (recycling of TRUs from fertile-free fuel), the GFR is designed to, in equilibrium, recycle TRU+U after extraction of fission products only. It is assumed that thermal recycling is available in the short-term (2015), as opposed to recycling in fast reactors (2040). Finally, thermal recycling is the most flexible as either CONFU batches or regular LWR uranium batches can be loaded; the issue of running out of TRU fuel is therefore irrelevant for this option. A fuel cycle simulation tool, CAFCA II - Code for Advanced Fuel Cycles Assessment - has been developed. The CAFCA II code tracks the mass distribution of TRU in the system and the cost of all operations.(cont.) The code includes a specific model for recycling plants deployment; as an industrial process occurring in facilities with given capacities and investment requirements. These facilities may operate with a minimum target capacity factor during the lifetime of the plant. The deployment of these facilities is also constrained by a user-specified ability to add recycling capacity within a given time interval. Finally, the CAFCA II code includes a specific model for recycling prices as a function of plants nominal capacities, which reflects the economies of scale that go with increasing the nominal capacity of recycling plants. Our first case-study identifies the optimal choice of fuel cycle option and recycling plants capacities as a function of the deployment of advanced fuel cycle technologies over the next hundred years and under the assumption of the US demand for nuclear energy growing at a 2.4\% annual rate. Key figures of merit for comparison of the strategies are the reduction of TRU interim storage requirements, the maximization of TRU incineration, the minimization of the size of the fleets of recycling plants and fast reactors, and the fuel cycle cost. We found that it is not possible to minimize simultaneously (1) the construction rate of advanced reactors and advanced spent fuel recycling facilities, and (2) the construction rate of U02 spent fuel separation facilities. The latter was found to be more constraining than the first for purposes of TRU inventories reduction. We found also that reactor technologies with zero net TRU destruction rate can achieve total depletion of TRU inventories is spent fuel interim storage at a lower fuel cycle cost and with fewer recycling facilities than reactor technologies that incinerate TRU; the lower fuel cycle cost is achieved at the expense of a lesser reduction of total TRU inventories.(cont.) Finally, we found that, if the construction rate of advanced nuclear technologies is large enough, the later introduction date of fast recycling schemes compared to thermal recycling schemes is not discriminatory, with regards to the reduction of TRU inventories in interim storage by 2100. The potential of multi-lateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle has recently been widely acknowledged. Cited benefits include cost attractiveness following from economies of scale, proliferation resistance and collaborative and more efficient nuclear waste treatment strategy. CAFCA II has been developed to quantify these trade implications for the back-end of the fuel cycle Three bi-lateral scenarios of partnerships have been examined between two regions: first a scenario where the "Fuel-leasing/fuel take-back" concept is implemented, second a scenario with "Limited Collaboration" at the back-end fuel cycle, where spent fuel recycling and advanced fuel fabrication are externalized in countries that have these technologies, and third a scenario of "Full Collaboration", under which two regions fully collaborate at the fuel cycle back-end: spent fuel inventories and advanced fuel cycle facilities are co-owned and comanaged. Our second case-study concentrates on optimizing the choice of (1) fuel cycle option, (2) spent fuel recycling plant capacities, and (3) partnership scenario by analyzing the implications of these choices for the LWR-CONFU, LWR/ABR, and LWR/GFR strategies. The nuclear fuel cycle is simulated in a two-region context from 2005 to 2100 under the assumption that one region represents the US growing at a 2.4\% annual rate and the other region represents Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico growing at a 7.4\% annual rate until 2080, and at 2.4\% afterwards.(cont.) We found that a US partnership with Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia, could be advantageous to the reduction of TRU storage in both regions if the construction rate of UO2 spent fuel separation plants would be larger than one 1,000 MT/yr plant every two years after 2050. We found also that, from the point of view of the spent fuel recycling industry, use of largest recycling plants with the lowest construction cost per unit of installed capacity becomes optimal only with multi-national approaches to the fuel cycle back-end.},

Proliferation-resistant nuclear energy systems are of great importance for the peaceful use of nuclear energy by impeding the diversion or undeclared production of weapons-usable material by states. Since the National Alternative Systems Assessment Program (NASAP) carried out the assessment of proliferation resistance of the civil nuclear energy systems in late 1970s, several comprehensive studies have been performed, including the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE) by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Spent Fuel Standard by the United States National Academy of Science, the Technical Opportunities for Increasing the Proliferation Resistance of Global Civilian Nuclear Power Systems (TOPS) by the United States Department of Energy, the International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) Methodology by the IAEA, and the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems (Gen IV) by the Gen IV International Forum. However, all these studies appear lack in the interpretation of country-specific proliferation risk that is arbitrary imposed to the specific countries by major nuclear weapons states, even though the countries are members of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). This paper outlines the assessments of proliferation resistance of the above studies, points out the country-specific proliferation risk, and suggests further studies to increase the proliferation resistance of the civil nuclear energy systems in the specific NPT member countries such as South Korea.},

	abstract = {Since the early nineteen seventies, a lot of effort has
been put into trying to define and evaluate the proliferation
resistance of nuclear energy systems and
their associated nuclear fuel cycles. Past studies put
in evidence how it was not possible to conceive a
proliferation-free nuclear fuel cycle (hence the need
of a suitable safeguards system), but also stressed
that not all of the available options are equivalent.
The topic has become of renewed interest, in the
context of the innovative reactor and nuclear energy
systems design concepts presently under development.
New reactors will have to exhibit and demonstrate
enhanced features with respect to the existing
ones.
It is common practice to classify Proliferation Resistance
and Physical Protection characteristics of a
system as either intrinsic, i.e. belonging to the system,
or extrinsic, such as those related to the application
of international safeguards.
This paper will summarise in a critical way some of
the Proliferation Resistance \& Physical Protection
(PR\&PP) intrinsic features that have emerged so far,
in a number of studies and reports available in this
field, and can contribute to provide a first input to
designers to brainstorm on a number of possible requirements.
This survey is part of a JRC activity
contributing to the Generation IV International Forum

	abstract = {Over the past several years, the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) has been developing an
evaluation methodology for proliferation resistance and physical protection (PR\&PP) of nuclear
energy systems1, through collaboration between the countries and international organizations that
participate in GIF. Generation IV nuclear energy systems are nuclear reactor technologies that
could be deployed by 2030 and would present significant improvements over currently operating
reactor technologies. The technology goals for GIF highlight PR\&PP as one of the four goal
areas, along with sustainability, safety and reliability, and economics. The PR\&PP evaluation
methodology that has been developed is a result of a consensus among the GIF participants, and
has been approved by GIF for broad dissemination and use.
In parallel with this multilateral effort by GIF, and over the same time period, the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been sponsoring development of an International Project on
Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) to help to ensure that nuclear energy is
available in the 21st century in a sustainable manner. In particular, INPRO has put forth basic
principles, user requirements, and criteria for future nuclear energy systems, with similar broad
goal areas to those that are being considered by GIF, including proliferation resistance and
physical protection.
This paper describes an effort to address the compatibility and use of the two methodologies,
starting with proliferation resistance, in order to more fully understand and articulate the range of
applicability and the potential for synergy in their application. “Proliferation resistance”
evaluation is in its early stages, and on-going efforts to use the methodologies to assess particular
fuel cycles or facilities will shed further light on what proliferation resistance means, how best it
can be assessed, and their value to policy-makers, facility designers and users of nuclear
facilities. The authors of this paper report on the status of progress on this effort, particularly
with regard to the respective objectives, analysis approaches, input requirements, form of results
and end uses. The views expressed herein are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect

Pathway {Analysis} ({PRADA})},
	abstract = {This report presents the results of the International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors
and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) Collaborative Project on Proliferation Resistance:
Acquisition/Diversion Pathway Analysis (PRADA), undertaken under INPRO Programme
Area A. INPRO was launched in 2000, on the basis of a resolution of the IAEA General
Conference (GC(44)/RES/21) to ensure that nuclear energy is available in the 21st century in a
sustainable manner, and seeks to bring together all interested Member States — both
technology holders and technology users — to consider actions to achieve innovation.
Programme Area A of INPRO, Nuclear Energy System Assessments (NESAs) using the
INPRO Methodology, is aimed at assisting Member States in assessing existing or future
nuclear energy systems in a holistic way to determine if such systems meet international
sustainable development criteria.
One important factor for sustainability is deploying innovative nuclear energy systems (INS)
in a safe and secure way to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. The basic
principle for proliferation resistance (minimizing proliferation risk) requires that intrinsic
features (features that result from the technical design of the INS) and extrinsic measures
(States’ commitments, obligations, and policies) of proliferation resistance be implemented
throughout the full life cycle of the INS to ensure that the system will be an unattractive
means of acquiring fissile material or technology for a nuclear weapons programme. An INS
should incorporate multiple proliferation resistance features and measures. These features and
measures must overlap in a layered fashion to provide multiple barriers to each of the possible
proliferation pathways. In this context, the overall objective of this project was to further
develop the INPRO proliferation resistance assessment methodology.
The specific objectives of the PRADA study were to:
• develop appropriate methods for the identification and analysis of pathways for the
acquisition of weapon-useable nuclear material;
• evaluate the multiplicity and robustness of barriers against proliferation for the
pathway by logic trees (e.g. success/failure trees, event trees) and/or qualitative
methods; and
• on the basis of the above results, recommend an assessment approach for User
Requirement 4 (UR4) of the INPRO Methodology, regarding the multiplicity and
robustness of barriers against proliferation.
As a test of the methodology, PRADA focused on identifying and analysing only some of the
higher level pathways for the acquisition of fissile material for a nuclear weapons programme.
A case study was made using the process known as DUPIC (direct use of PWR spent fuel in
CANDU reactors). The CANDU reactor used in the DUPIC system served to develop
appropriate methods for the identification and analysis of plausible acquisition paths. The
study also resulted in recommendations for assessing the multiplicity and robustness of
barriers against proliferation, including institutional, material, and technical barriers, as well
as barriers due to the implementation of international safeguards. This was not a
comprehensive study of DUPIC or CANDU reactors.
The PRADA project was initiated in 2008. The Republic of Korea, which had been
developing the DUPIC process, assumed the project lead and was supported by participation
from Canada, China, the USA, and the European Commission. In addition, the Russian
Federation and Japan, participating as observers, contributed to the project. Within the IAEA,
the PRADA study was conducted in close cooperation with the Departments of Nuclear
Energy and Safeguards. The PRADA study was completed within the planned project schedule. The final working group meeting took place 8–10 November 2010 at the IAEA
Headquarters in Vienna, during which the final report was reviewed and approved for IAEA
publication.
The main conclusions of the PRADA study are that:
• the proliferation resistance assessment should be performed at three levels: the State
level, the INS level, and the facility level including facility specific pathways.
• the robustness of barriers against proliferation depends on the State capabilities and
the relevance of barriers is not the same at the different levels of evaluation listed
above.
• the robustness of barriers is not a function of the number of barriers or of their
individual characteristics but is an integrated function of the whole, and is measured
by determining whether and with what confidence the safeguards goals can be met.
• in addition, the INPRO assessment methodology needs information regarding
proliferation risks from more quantitative analyses performed jointly by technology
developers (suppliers), safeguards experts, and experts in proliferation resistance.
The PRADA study identified several areas where the INPRO proliferation assessment
methodology could be expanded and improved:
• A better explanation of acceptance limits.
• A reformatting and restructuring of the evaluation tables to include needed details.
The PRADA study also recognized the desirability of forming a ‘GIF/INPRO coordinated set
of proliferation resistance and safeguardability assessment tools’. This set of tools would
bring together the complementary strengths of the GIF and INPRO approaches and clearly
demonstrate that the two methods could be used in harmony and provide consistent results.
The PRADA study recommended that an expanded test of the methodology be applied to a
new example study to demonstrate usefulness and validate the approach, and this study should
address a complete nuclear energy system in a State. The expanded test should cover
transportation and multiple facilities, including a reactor and waste disposal. The example
studies proposed include: (1) an open fuel cycle in an emerging nuclear State, a country
interested in beginning a commercial nuclear power programme, and (2) a generic
pyroprocessing fuel cycle not attached to any State but building on the GIF ESFR study, using
an INPRO based approach.},

	abstract = {The prospects for a dramatic growth in nuclear power may depend to a significant degree on the
effectiveness of, and the resources devoted to, plans to develop and implement technologies and
approaches that strengthen proliferation resistance and nuclear materials accountability. The
challenges for fast reactors and related fuel cycles are especially critical. They are being explored in
the Generation IV International Forum (GTF) and the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA's)
International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) initiative, as well as by
many states that are looking to these systems for the efficient use of uranium resources and long-term
energy security. How do any proliferation risks they may pose compare to other reactors, both existing
and under development, and their fuel cycles? Can they be designed with intrinsic (technological)
features to make these systems more proliferation resistant? What roles can extrinsic (institutional)
features play in proliferation resistance? What are the anticipated safeguards requirements, and will
new technologies and approaches need to be developed? How can safeguards be facilitated by the
design process? These and other questions require a rethinking of proliferation resistance and the
prospects for new technologies and other intrinsic and extrinsic features being developed that are
responsive to specific issues for fast reactors and related fuel cycles and to the broader threat
environment in which these systems will have to operate. There are no technologies that can wholly
eliminate the risk of proliferation by a determined state, but technology and design can play a role in
reducing state threats and perhaps in eliminating non-state threats. There will be a significant role for extrinsic factors, especially the various measures-from safeguards and physical protection to export
controls---embodied in the international nuclear nonproliferation regime. This paper will offer an
assessment of the issues surrounding, and the prospects for, efforts to develop proliferation resistance
for fast reactors and related fuel cycles in the context of a nuclear renaissance. The focus of the
analysis is on fast reactors.},

The task is formidable considering the numerous fuel cycle options, the large dynamic systems that each represent, and the necessity to accurately predict their behavior. The path to successfully develop and implement an advanced fuel cycle is highly dependent on the modeling capabilities and simulation tools available for performing useful relevant analysis to assist stakeholders in decision making. Therefore a high-fidelity fuel cycle simulation tool that performs system analysis, including uncertainty quantification and optimization was developed. The resulting simulator also includes the capability to calculate environmental impact measures for individual components and the system.
An integrated system method and analysis approach that provides consistent and comprehensive evaluations of advanced fuel cycles was developed. A general approach was utilized allowing for the system to be modified in order to provide analysis for other systems with similar attributes. By utilizing this approach, the framework for simulating many different fuel cycle options is provided. Two example fuel cycle configurations were developed to take advantage of used fuel recycling and transmutation capabilities in waste management scenarios leading to minimized waste inventories.},

	abstract = {Finding answers to main challenges of nuclear energy, like resource utilisation or waste minimisation, calls for transient fuel cycle modelling. This motivation led to the development of SITON v2.0 a dynamic, discrete facilities/discrete materials and also discrete events fuel cycle simulation code. The physical model of the code includes the most important fuel cycle facilities. Facilities can be connected flexibly; their number is not limited. Material transfer between facilities is tracked by taking into account 52 nuclides. Composition of discharged fuel is determined using burnup tables except for the 2400 MW thermal power design of the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR2400). For the GFR2400 the FITXS method is used, which fits one-group microscopic cross-sections as polynomial functions of the fuel composition. This method is accurate and fast enough to be used in fuel cycle simulations. Operation of the fuel cycle, i.e. material requests and transfers, is described by discrete events. In advance of the simulation reactors and plants formulate their requests as events; triggered requests are tracked. After that, the events are simulated, i.e. the requests are fulfilled and composition of the material flow between facilities is calculated.

To demonstrate capabilities of SITON v2.0, a hypothetical transient fuel cycle is presented in which a 4-unit VVER-440 reactor park was replaced by one GFR2400 that recycled its own spent fuel. It is found that the GFR2400 can be started if the cooling time of its spent fuel is 2 years. However, if the cooling time is 5 years it needs an additional plutonium feed, which can be covered from the spent fuel of a Generation III light water reactor.},

	abstract = {Over the next 50 years, unless patterns change dramatically, energy production and use will contribute to global warming through large- scale greenhouse gas emissions — hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon in the form of car- bon dioxide. Nuclear power could be one option for reducing carbon emissions. At pres- ent, however, this is unlikely: nuclear power faces stagnation and decline.
This study analyzes what would be required to retain nuclear power as a significant option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting growing needs for electricity supply. Our analy- sis is guided by a global growth scenario that would expand current worldwide nuclear gen- erating capacity almost threefold, to 1000 bil- lion watts, by the year 2050. Such a deployment would avoid 1.8 billion tonnes of carbon emis- sions annually from coal plants, about 25\% of the increment in carbon emissions otherwise expected in a business-as-usual scenario. This study also recommends changes in government policy and industrial practice needed in the rel- atively near term to retain an option for such an outcome.
We did not analyze other options for reducing carbon emissions — renewable energy sources, carbon sequestration, and increased energy effi- ciency — and therefore reach no conclusions about priorities among these efforts and nuclear power. In our judgment, it would be a mistake to exclude any of these four options at this time.},

The parameters of the centrifugal machine investigated were close to the parameters of the Iguassu machine. The dependence of the efficiency criterion versus the basic parameters of the separation process has been explored in the computational experiments.

	abstract = {Examples of coupled irreversible processes like the thermoelectric phenomena, the
transference phenomena in electrolytes and heat conduction in an anisotropic medium
are considered. For certain cases of such interaction reciprocal relations have been
deduced by earlier writers, e,g., Thomson's theory of thermoelectric phenomena and
Helmholtz' theory for the e.m.f. of electrolytic cells with liquid junction. These earlier
derivations may be classed as quasi-thermodynamic; in fact, Thomson himself pointed
out that his argument was incomplete, and that: his relation ought to be established on
an experimental basis. A general class of such relations will be derived by a new
theoretical treatment from the principle of microscopic reversibility. ()\$1-2.) The
analogy with a chemical monomolecular triangle reaction is discussed; in this case a
a simple kinetic consideration assuming microscopic reversibility yields a reciprocal
relation that is not necessary for fulfilling the requirements of thermodynamics (\$3).
Reciprocal relations for heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are derived from
the assumption of microscopic reversibility, applied to fluctuations. (\$4.) The reciprocal
relations can be expressed in terms of a potential, the dissipation-function. Lord
Rayleigh's "principle of the least dissipation of energy" is generalized to include the
case of anisotropic heat conduction. A further generalization is announced. (\$5.\vphantom{\{}\} The
conditions for stationary flow are formulated; the connection with earlier quasithermodynamic
theories is discussed. (\$6.) The principle of dynamical reversibility
does not apply when (external) magnetic fields or Coriolis forces are present, and the
reciprocal relations break down. (\$7.)},

	abstract = {This research involves the study of the long-term behaviors of Northern Thailand rainfall as affected by changes to its forest area and the rise in global temperature. Global temperature and forest data are considered annually while rainfall data are considered seasonally to best capture the effects of severe weather hazards such as draught and flood. A differential equation model was developed and verified using the mean global temperature data collected annually during 1880–2010, Northern Thailand forest area data collecting during 1973–2008, and data on the daily amounts of rainfall in Northern Thailand during 1971–2011. The rise in global temperature as well as the decline in Northern Thailand's forest area can be, as shown in the paper, represented by logistic equations. Northern Thailand rainfall is, however, represented as a periodic function; hence, second order differential equation, of which the solution is periodic, is used to represent the rate of change in the amount of rainfall. In addition, by correlation analysis, the predator-prey terms of forest, global temperature and rainfall are presented in the models. All parameters in the models are validated by minimizing sum squared error.},
